<name="viserys"> She has to eat a whole heart? I hope that wasn’t my horse
<name="jorah"> She’s doing well
<name="viserys"> She’ll never keep it down
<name="viserys"> Tell me what she is saying
<name="jorah"> The prince is riding I have heard the thunder of the hooves Swift as the wind he rides His enemies will cower before him and their wives will weep tears of blood

<name="jorah"> And you have all three
<name="viserys"> I need a large army I’m the last hope of a dynasty, Mormont The greatest dynasty this world has ever seen, on my shoulders since I was five years old and no one has ever given me what they gave to her in that tent Never Not a piece of it How can I carry what I need to carry without it? Hmm? Who can rule without wealth, or fear, or love? Oh, you stand there, all nobility and honor You don’t think I see you looking at my little sister, hmm? Don’t think I know what you want? I don’t care You can have her She can be queen of the savages and dine on the finest bloody horseparts, and you can dine on whichever parts of her you like But let me go
<name="jorah"> You can go, but you can’t have the eggs
<name="viserys"> You swore an oath to me Does loyalty mean nothing to you?
<name="jorah"> It means everything to me
<name="viserys"> And yet here you stand?
<name="jorah"> And here I stand -
<name="tyrion"> Mord! Mord! Mord! Mord! Mord
<name="mord"> Noise again
<name="tyrion"> About the gold
<name="mord"> No gold
<name="tyrion"> Listen to me! Listen to me! Sometimes possession is an abstract concept When they captured me they took my purse, but the gold is still mine
<name="mord"> Where?
<name="tyrion"> Where? I don’t know where, but when they free me
<name="mord"> You want free? Go be free
<name="tyrion"> Have you ever heard the phrase Rich as a Lannister”? Of course you have You’re a smart man You know who the Lannisters are I am a Lannister Tyrion, son of Tywin! And of course, you have also heard the phrase, a Lannister always pays his debts.” If you deliver a message from me to Lady Arryn, I will be in your debt I will owe you gold If you deliver the message and I live, which I very much intend to do
<name="mord"> What message?
<name="tyrion"> Tell her I wish to confess my crimes
<name="lysa arryn"> You wish to confess your crimes?
<name="tyrion"> Yes, my lady I do, my lady
<name="lysa arryn"> Skycells always break them Speak, Imp Meet your gods as an honest man
<name="tyrion"> Where do I begin, my lords and ladies? I’m a vile man, I confess it My crimes and sins are beyond counting I have lied and cheated, gambled and whored I’m not particularly good at violence, but I’m good at convincing others to do violence for me You want specifics, I suppose When I was seven, I saw a servant girl bathing in the river I stole her robe She was forced to return to the castle, naked and in tears I close my eyes, I can still see her tits bouncing When I was ten, I stuffed my uncle’s boots with goatshit When confronted with my crime, I blamed a squire Poor boy was flogged and I escaped justice When I was twelve, I milked my eel into a pot of turtle stew I flogged the one-eyed snake I skinned my sausage I made the bald man cry into the turtle stew, which I do believe my sister ate At least I hope she did I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel
<name="lysa arryn"> Silence
<name="robin arryn"> What happened next?
<name="lysa arryn"> What do you think you’re doing?
<name="tyrion"> Confessing my crimes
<name="catelyn"> Lord Tyrion, you are accused of hiring a man to slay my son Bran in his bed, and of conspiring to murder my sister’s husband; Lord Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King
<name="tyrion"> Oh, I’m very sorry I don’t know anything about all that
<name="lysa arryn"> You’ve had your little joke I trust you enjoyed it Mord, take him back to the dungeon But this time find a smaller cell, with a steeper floor
<name="tyrion"> Is this how justice is done in the Vale? you accuse me of crimes, I deny them, so you throw me in a cell to freeze and starve? Where is the King’s Justice? I’m accused and demand a trial
<name="lysa arryn"> If you’re tried and found guilty, then by the king’s own laws you will pay with your life
<name="tyrion"> I understand the law
<name="lysa arryn"> We have no executioner in the Eyrie Life is more elegant here Open the Moon Door
<name="lysa arryn"> You want a trial, my Lord Lannister Very well My son will listen to whatever you have to say, and you will hear his judgement Then you will leave, by one door or the other
<name="tyrion"> No need to bother Lord Robin I demand a trial by combat
<name="lysa arryn"> You have that right
<name="knight"> My lady, I beg the honor Let me be your champion
<name="knight"> The honor should be mine For the love I bore your lord husband let me avenge his death
<name="knight"> I’ll fight for you, my Lady
<name="knight"> It’ll be my honor
<name="knight"> The honor should be mine
<name="robin arryn"> Make the bad man fly
<name="lysa arryn"> You’re quiet Did you want to avenge my husband?
<name="ser vardis"> With all my heart, my Lady But the Imp is half my size It would be shameful to slaughter such a man and call it justice
<name="tyrion"> Agreed
<name="lysa arryn"> You demanded a trial by combat
<name="tyrion"> Now I demand a champion I have that right, same as you
<name="ser vardis"> My Lady, I would gladly fight the Imp’s champion for you
<name="tyrion"> I wouldn’t be too glad, ser I name my brother, Jaime Lannister
<name="lysa arryn"> ingslayer is hundreds of miles from here
<name="tyrion"> Send a raven for him, I’m happy to wait
<name="lysa arryn"> The trial will be today
<name="tyrion"> Do I have a volunteer?
<name="tyrion"> Anyone? Anyone?
<name="lysa arryn"> I think that we can assume that no one is willing
<name="bronn"> I’ll stand for the dwarf -
<name="lancel"> More wine, your Grace?
<name="robert"> Oh, what was I saying?
<name="renly"> A simpler time
<name="robert"> It was! It was You’re too young to remember Wasn’t it, Selmy?
<name="barriston"> It was, your Grace
<name="robert"> The enemy was right there in the open, vicious as you like, all but sending you a bloody invitation Nothing like today
<name="renly"> Sounds exhilarating
<name="robert"> Exhilarating, yes Not as exhilarating as those balls and masquerades you like to throw You ever fucked a Riverlands girl?
<name="renly"> Once, I think
<name="robert"> You think? I think you’d remember Back in our day, you weren’t a real man until you fucked a girl from each of the Seven Kingdoms and the Riverlands We called it making the eight
<name="renly"> Those were some lucky girls
<name="robert"> You ever make the eight, Barristan?
<name="barristan selmy"> I don’t believe so, your Grace
<name="robert"> Those were the days
<name="renly"> What days were those? The ones where half of Westeros fought the other half and millions died? Or before that, when the Mad King slaughtered women and babies because the voices in his head told him they deserved it? Or way before that when dragons burned whole cities to the ground?
<name="robert"> Easy, boy You might be my brother, but you’re speaking to the King
<name="renly"> I suppose it was all rather heroic If you were drunk enough and had some poor Riverlands whore to shove your price inside and make the eight
<name="lancel"> More wine, your Grace? -
<name="man"> They burned most everything in the Riverlands, our fields, our granaries, our homes They took our women and then they took em again When they was done, they butchered them as if they was animals They covered our children in pitch and lit them on fire
<name="grand maester pycelle"> Brigands, most likely
<name="man"> They weren’t thieves, they didn’t steal nothing They even left something behind, your Grace
<name="grand maester pycelle"> It’s the King’s Hand you’re addressing, not the king The king is hunting
<name="littlefinger"> Fish The sigil of House Tully Isn’t that your wife’s House Tully my Lord Hand?
<name="ned"> These men, were they flying a sigil? A banner
<name="man"> None, your Hand The one who was leading them Taller by a foot than any man I’ve ever met, saw him cut the blacksmith, saw him take the head off a horse with a single swing of his sword
<name="littlefinger"> That sounds like someone we know The Mountain
<name="ned"> You’re describing Ser Gregor Clegane
<name="grand maester pycelle"> Why should Ser Gregor turn brigand? The man is an anointed knight
<name="littlefinger"> I’ve heard him called Tywin Lannister’s mad dog.” I’m sure you have as well Can you think of any reason the Lannisters might possibly have for being angry with your wife?
<name="grand maester pycelle"> If the Lannisters were to order attacks on villages under the king’s protection, it would be
<name="littlefinger"> It would be almost as brazen as attacking the Hand of the King in the streets of the capital
<name="grand maester pycelle"> Wel
<name="ned"> I cannot give you back your homes or restore your dead to life But perhaps I can give you justice in the name of our king, Robert Lord Beric Dondarrion
<name="ned"> You shall have the command Assemble 100 men and ride to Ser Gregor’s keep
<name="beric dondarrion"> As you command
<name="ned"> In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, the First of his Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, I charge you to bring the king’s justice to the false knight Gregor Clegane and all those who shared in his crimes I denounce him and attaint him I strip him of all ranks and titles of all lands and holdings, and sentence him to death
<name="grand maester pycelle"> My lord This This is a drastic action It would be better to wait for King Robert’s return
<name="grand maester pycelle"> My Lord
<name="ned"> Send a raven to Casterly Rock Inform Tywin Lannister that he has been summoned to court to answer for the crimes of his bannermen He will arrive within the fortnight, or be branded an enemy of the crown and a traitor to the realm
<name="littlefinger"> A bold move, my Lord, and admirable But is it wise to yank the lion’s tail? Tywin Lannister is the richest man in all the Seven Kingdoms Gold wins wars, not soldiers
<name="ned"> Then how come Robert is king and not Tywin Lannister? -
<name="robin arryn"> Is it over?
<name="lysa arryn"> You don’t fight with honor
<name="bronn"> No
<name="robin arryn"> Can I make the little man fly now?
<name="tyrion"> Not this little man This little man is going home I believe you have something of mine
<name="tyrion"> A Lannister always pays his debts -
<name="mordane"> You wear your hair like a real southern lady now
<name="sansa"> Well, why shouldn’t I? We’re in the south
<name="mordane"> It’s important to remember where you come from I’m not sure your mother would like these new styles
<name="sansa"> My mother isn’t from the North
<name="mordane"> I’m aware of that
<name="sansa"> Why do you care? Do you even have hair under there?
<name="mordane"> Yes I have hair
<name="sansa"> I’ve never seen it
<name="mordane"> Would you like to?
<name="sansa"> No Where are you from anyway, the north or the south?
<name="mordane"> I come from a very small village in
<name="sansa"> Oh, wait I just realized I don’t care
<name="mordane"> Sansa
<name="sansa"> Septa
<name="mordane"> Now you are being rude
<name="mordane"> My prince
<name="sansa"> My prince
<name="joffrey"> My lady I fear I have behaved monstrously the past few weeks With your permission?
<name="sansa"> It’s beautiful Like the one your mother wears
<name="joffrey"> You’ll be queen one day, it’s only fitting that you should look the part Will you forgive me for my rudeness?
<name="sansa"> There’s nothing to forgive
<name="joffrey"> You’re my lady One day we’ll be married in the throne room Lords and ladies from all over the Seven Kingdoms will come, from the last hearth in the North, to the salt shore of the south And you will be queen over all of them I’ll never disrespect you again I’ll never be cruel to you again Do you understand me? You’re my lady now, from this day, until my last day -
<name="theon"> Stop! Stop! What are you doing?
<name="ros"> Going to King’s Landing
<name="theon"> In a turnip cart?
<name="ros"> I’ll find a ship heading south in White Harbor
<name="theon"> And you can afford that?
<name="ros"> Some of my friends are more generous than others
<name="theon"> There’s a thousand girls like you in King’s Landing
<name="ros"> I’ll have lots of company
<name="theon"> Yes, you’ll be very popular until some fat lord comes to visit with a big belly and a little prick and he can’t get it up so he knocks all your teeth out
<name="ros"> And what will happen to me if I stay here? Will I become Lady Greyjoy, Mistress of the Iron Islands?
<name="theon"> Don’t be a fool
<name="ros"> I hear Jaime Lannister attacked Lord Stark in the streets of King’s Landing Every man for a hundred miles will be marching off to war soon and most of them will never come back, there’s nothing more for me here Let’s go, Steffon
<name="theon"> Let me see it one more time?
<name="ros"> See what?
<name="theon"> I’m going to miss you
<name="ros"> I know -
<name="ned"> I’m sending you both back to Winterfell
<name="sansa"> What?
<name="ned"> Listen
<name="sansa"> What about Joffrey?
<name="arya"> Are you dying because of your leg? Is that why you’re sending us home?
<name="ned"> What? No
<name="sansa"> Please, Father Please don’t
<name="arya"> You can’t I’ve got my lessons with Syrio I’m finally getting good
<name="ned"> This isn’t a punishment I want you back in Winterfell for your own safety
<name="arya"> Can’t we take Syrio back with us?
<name="sansa"> Who cares about your stupid dancing teacher? I can’t go I’m supposed to marry Prince Joffrey I love him and I’m meant to be his queen and have his babies
<name="arya"> Seven hells
<name="ned"> When you’re old enough, I’ll make you a match with someone who’s worthy of you, someone who’s brave and gentle and strong
<name="sansa"> I don’t want someone brave and gentle and strong I want him! He’ll be the greatest king that ever was, a golden lion, and I’ll give him sons with beautiful blond hair
<name="arya"> The lion’s not his sigil, idiot He’s a stag, like his father
<name="sansa"> He is not He’s nothing like that old drunk king
<name="ned"> Go on, girls Get your septa and start packing your things
<name="sansa"> Wait
<name="arya"> Come on
<name="sansa"> It’s not fair
<name="ned"> Lord Orys Baratheon, black of hair.” Axel Baratheon, black of hair.” Lyonel Baratheon, black of hair.” Steffon Baratheon, black of hair.” Robert Baratheon, black of hair.” Joffrey Baratheon golden-haired.” -

<name="robb"> My father would do whatever it took to secure our crossing Whatever it took lf lm going to lead this army, l cant have other men doing my bargaining for me
<name="catelyn"> l agree lll go
<name="everyone"> You cant
<name="catelyn"> l have known Lord Walder since l was a girl He would never harm me
<name="greatjon umber"> Unless there was a profit in it er
<name="walder frey"> What do you want?
<name="catelyn"> lt is a great pleasure to see you again after so many years, my lord
<name="walder frey"> Oh, spare me Your boys too proud to come before me himself What am l supposed to do with you?
<name="stevron frey"> Father, you forget yourself Lady Stark is
<name="walder frey"> Who asked you? Youre not Lord Frey yet, not until l die Do l look dead to you?
<name="ryger rivers"> Father, please
<name="walder frey"> l need lessons in courtesy from you, bastard? Your mother would still be a milkmaid if l hadnt squirted you into her belly All right, you come forward There Now that lve observed the courtesies, perhaps my sons will do me the honor of shutting their mouths
<name="catelyn"> ls there somewhere we can talk?
<name="walder frey"> Were talking right now Fine Out! All of you! Oh! You too You see that? Fifteen, she is A little flower And her honeys all mine
<name="catelyn"> lm sure she will give you many sons
<name="walder frey"> Huh Your father didnt come to the wedding
<name="catelyn"> He is quite ill, my lord
<name="walder frey"> Huh Didnt come to the last one, either Or the one before that Your family has always pissed on me
<name="catelyn"> My lord, l
<name="walder frey"> Dont deny it You know its true The fine Lord Tully would never marry any of his children to mine
<name="catelyn"> lm sure there were reasons
<name="walder frey"> l didnt need reasons l needed to get rid of sons and daughters You see how they pile up? Why are you here?
<name="catelyn"> To ask you to open your gates, my lord, so my son and his bannermen may cross the Trident and be on their way
<name="walder frey"> Why should l let him?
<name="catelyn"> lf you could climb your own battlements, you would see that he has 20,000 men outside your walls
<name="walder frey"> There will be 20,000 corpses when Tywin Lannister gets here Dont try and frighten me, Lady Stark Your husbands in a cell beneath the Red Keep and your sons got no fur to keep his balls warm
<name="catelyn"> You swore an oath to my father
<name="walder frey"> Oh, yes, l said some words And l swore oaths to the crown too, if l remember right Joffreys king now, which makes your boy and his corpses-to-be nothing but rebels, it seems to me lf l had the sense the gods gave a fish, ld hand you both over to the Lannisters
<name="catelyn"> Why dont you?
<name="walder frey"> Stark, Tully, Lannister, Baratheon Give me one good reason why l should waste a single thought on any of you? -
<name="voices outside"> And engage
<name="jeor"> When does Aemon think youll be able to use that hand?
<name="jon"> Soon, he says
<name="jeor"> Good Youll be ready for this, then l thought a wolf was more appropriate for you than a bear so l had a new pommel made lts called Longclaw Works as well for a wolf as a bear, l think
<name="jon"> This is Valyrian steel
<name="jeor"> lt was my fathers sword, his father before him The Mormonts have carried it for five centuries lt was meant for my son Jorah He brought dishonor to our House, but he had the grace to leave the sword before he fled from Westeros
<name="jon"> My lord, you honor me, but l cant
<name="jeor"> Oh, you can And you will l wouldnt be standing here if it wasnt for you and your beast A bloody dead man tried to kill me, so youll take it lll hear no more about it ls that understood?
<name="jon"> Yes, my lord
<name="jeor"> Right Now, dont think this means l approve of this nonsense with you and Alliser Thorne Thats a mans sword ltll take a man to wield it
<name="jon"> lll apologize to Ser Alliser tonight
<name="jeor"> No, you wont l sent him to Kings Landing yesterday The hand that your wolf tore off that things wrist – lve ordered Thorne to lay it at the feet of this boy king That should get young Joffreys attention And it, uh, puts a thousand leagues between you and Thorne Now go and put your sword somewhere safe and bring me my supper
<name="jon"> Yes, my lord Unidentified Night
<name="watchers"> Well done Well done.Night
<name="watcher"> You earned that, Snow.Night
<name="watcher"> Well done
<name="pyp"> Go on, lets have a look
<name="jon"> At what?
<name="grenn"> The sword! Show us the sword
<name="all"> Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword
<name="pyp"> Lets have a look
<name="grenn"> Piss off
<name="pyp"> Come on, l want to have a look at it in the light Give it here
<name="grenn"> Look at its eyes
<name="jon"> What is it?
<name="sam"> l l cant
<name="jon"> You cant what?
<name="sam"> lm really not supposed to say
<name="jon"> And yet you really want to say You want to say that
<name="sam"> There was a raven l read the message to Maester Aemon lts your brother Robb
<name="jon"> What? What about him?
<name="sam"> Hes heading south To war All his bannermen have rallied to his side, theyll keep him safe
<name="jon"> l should be there l should be with him -
<name="greatjon umber"> lf we do that, theyll never get back across
<name="robb"> Well? What did he say?
<name="catelyn"> Lord Walder has granted your crossing His men are yours, as well
<name="robb"> Huh
<name="catelyn"> Less the 400 he will keep here to hold the crossing against any who would pursue you
<name="robb"> What does he want in return?
<name="catelyn"> You will be taking on his son Olyvar as your personal squire He expects a knighthood in good time
<name="robb"> Fine, fine And?
<name="catelyn"> And Arya will marry his son Waldron when they both come of age
<name="robb"> She wont be happy about that And?
<name="catelyn"> And when the fighting is done you will marry one of his daughters Whichever you prefer He has a number he thinks will be suitable
<name="robb"> l see Did you get a look at his daughters?
<name="catelyn"> l did
<name="robb"> And?
<name="catelyn"> One was – Do you consent?
<name="robb"> Can l refuse?
<name="catelyn"> Not if you want to cross
<name="robb"> Then l consent -
<name="jon"> Sam said you wanted to see me?
<name="maester aemon"> l did indeed Perhaps you would be kind enough to assist me Tell me, did you ever wonder why the men of the Nights Watch take no wives and father no children?
<name="jon"> No
<name="maester aemon"> So they will not love Love is the death of duty lf the day should ever come when your lord father was forced to choose between honor on the one hand and those he loves on the other, what would he do?
<name="jon"> He would do whatever was right, no matter what
<name="maester aemon"> Then Lord Stark is one man in 10,000 Most of us are not so strong What is honor compared to a womans love? And what is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms? Or a brothers smile?
<name="jon"> Sam told you
<name="maester aemon"> Were all human Oh, we all do our duty when theres no cost to it Honor comes easy then Yet sooner or later in every mans life there comes a day when it is not easy A day when he must choose
<name="jon"> And this is my day? ls that what youre saying?
<name="maester aemon"> Oh, it hurts, boy Oh, yes l know
<name="jon"> You do not know No one knows l may be a bastard, but he is my father and Robb is my brother
<name="maester aemon"> The gods were cruel when they saw fit to test my vows They waited till l was old What could l do when the ravens brought the news from the South the ruin of my House, the death of my family? l was helpless, blind, frail But when l heard they had killed my brothers son and his poor son and the children! Even the little children
<name="jon"> Who are you?
<name="maester aemon"> My father was Maekar, the first of his name My brother Aegon reigned after him when l had refused the throne And he was followed by his son Aerys whom they called the Mad King
<name="jon"> Youre Aemon Targaryen
<name="maester aemon"> lm a maester of the Citadel, bound in service to Castle Black and the Nights Watch l will not tell you to stay or go You must make that choice yourself and live with it for the rest of your days As l have -
<name="daenerys"> My lord My sun and stars Drogo
<name="khal drogo"> My horse
<name="cohollo"> Blood of my blood
<name="khal drogo"> No, l must ride
<name="qotho"> He fell from his horse A Khal who cannot ride is no Khal
<name="daenerys"> Hes tired, thats all He needs to rest Weve ridden far enough today Well camp here
<name="qotho"> This is no place to camp A woman does not give us orders Not even a Khaleesi
<name="daenerys"> Well camp here Tell them Khal Drogo commanded it
<name="qotho"> You do not command me, Khaleesi
<name="daenerys"> Find Mirri Maz Duur Bring her to me
<name="qotho"> The witch? lll bring you her head, Khaleesi
<name="daenerys"> Bring her to me unharmed or Khal Drogo will hear why you denied me
<name="qotho"> Hyah! Hyah!
<name="kevan"> Our scouts tell us the Stark host has moved south from the Twins with Lord Freys levies in tow Theyre a days march north
<name="tywin"> The boy may lack experience and sense, but he does have a certain mindless provincial courage
<name="tyrion"> Oh, do continue Didnt mean to interrupt
<name="tywin"> l do hope your savages are going to be of some use, otherwise weve wasted good steel on them
<name="kevan"> The great hairy one insisted he must have two battleaxes Heavy black steel, double-sided
<name="tyrion"> Shagga likes axes
<name="tywin"> When the battle commences, you and your wildlings will be in the vanguard
<name="tyrion"> The vanguard? Me and the tribesmen on the front lines?
<name="kevan"> They do seem rather ferocious
<name="tyrion"> Ferocious? Last night a Moon Brother stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage Three Stone Crows seized the Moon Brother and opened his throat Bronn managed to keep Shagga from chopping off the dead mans cock, which was fortunate, but even still, Ulf is demanding blood money, which Shagga and Gunthor refuse to pay
<name="tywin"> When soldiers lack discipline, the fault lies with their commander
<name="tyrion"> Surely there are ways to have me killed that would be less detrimental to the war effort
<name="tywin"> Therell be no more discussion on the matter
<name="tyrion"> lt appears lm not hungry after all Excuse me, my lords.Back at his tent, Tyrion finds Bronn there with a woman waiting there too
<name="tyrion"> Where did you find one so pretty at this hour?
<name="bronn"> l took her
<name="tyrion"> Took her? From whom?
<name="bronn"> From, uh, Ser Whats-his-name? l dont know Ginger cunt, three tents down
<name="tyrion"> And he didnt have anything to say about it?
<name="bronn"> He said something
<name="tyrion"> Well, the odds of me living long enough for him to retaliate have just dropped drastically Well be at the vanguard tomorrow
<name="bronn"> Oh, well l, uh, think lll go and find myself one
<name="tyrion"> Who are you?
<name="prostitute"> Who would you like me to be?
<name="tyrion"> What did your mother call you?
<name="prostitute"> Shae What did your mother call you?
<name="tyrion"> My mother died giving birth to me
<name="shae"> ls that why lm here? So we can talk about our mothers?
<name="tyrion"> What sort of accent is that?
<name="shae"> Foreign
<name="tyrion"> For
<name="shae"> What do you want from me?
<name="tyrion"> What do l want from you? l want you to share my tent l want you to pour my wine, laugh at my jokes, rub my legs when theyre sore after a days ride l want you to take no other man to bed for as long as were together And l want you to fuck me like its my last night in this world Which it may well be
<name="shae"> And what do l get?
<name="tyrion"> One safety No one will hurt you for as long as youre mine Two the pleasure of my company, which l have heard is spectacular
<name="shae"> Who told you this? Women you paid?
<name="tyrion"> And three more gold than you can spend if you lived a thousand years Do you accept my proposal?
<name="shae"> Lets start with your last night in this world Back across the Narrow Sea Drogo is mumbling incoherently in Dothraki inside a tent, Daenerys by his side
<name="jorah"> Khaleesi

<name="jorah"> He will die tonight, Khaleesi
<name="daenerys"> He cant He cant l wont let him

<name="daenerys"> l wont leave him
<name="jorah"> Hes already gone, Khaleesi
<name="daenerys"> Even if he dies, why would l run? l am khaleesi, and my my son will be khal after Drogo
<name="jorah"> This isnt Westeros, where men honor blood Here they only honor strength There will be fighting after Drogo dies Whoever wins that fight will be the new khal He wont want any rivals Your boy will be plucked from your breast and given to the dogs
<name="daenerys"> l wont leave him
<name="mirri maz duur"> The wound has festered
<name="qotho"> You did this, witch
<name="daenerys"> Stop it! l dont want her hurt
<name="qotho"> No? No? You dont want her hurt? Pray we dont hurt you, too You let this witch put her hands on our Khal
<name="jorah"> Rein in your tongue She is still your Khaleesi
<name="qotho"> Only while the blood of my blood lives When he dies, she is nothing
<name="daenerys"> l have never been nothing l am the blood of the dragon
<name="qotho"> The dragons are all dead, Khaleesi
<name="daenerys"> l think you should wear your armor tonight, ser
<name="jorah"> l think youre right
<name="mirri maz duur"> Youve saved me once more
<name="daenerys"> And now you must save him
<name="mirri maz duur"> Hes beyond the healers skills All l can do is ease his path
<name="daenerys"> Save him and l will free you l swear it You must know a way Some – some magic
<name="mirri maz duur"> There is a spell Some would say death is cleaner
<name="daenerys"> Do it Save him
<name="mirri maz duur"> There is a price
<name="daenerys"> Youll have gold, whatever you want
<name="mirri maz duur"> lts not a matter of gold This is blood magic Only death pays for life
<name="daenerys"> My death?
<name="mirri maz duur"> No, not your death, Khaleesi Bring me his horse
<name="rakharo"> Khaleesi, do not do this thing Let me kill this witch
<name="daenerys"> Kill her and you kill your khal
<name="rakharo"> This is blood magic lt is forbidden
<name="daenerys"> l am your khaleesi l tell you what is forbidden
<name="mirri maz duur"> Go Now
<name="daenerys"> Take her and leave Take her
<name="mirri maz duur"> You must go also, lady Once l begin to sing, no one must enter the tent The dead will dance here tonight
<name="daenerys"> No one will enter
<name="daenerys"> Bring him back to me What have you done?
<name="daenerys"> l have to save him.We could have been 10 miles away from here by now, on the way to Asshai You would have been safe
<name="qotho"> This must not be

<name="qotho"> Witch
<name="rakharo"> Nothing good will come of this
<name="daenerys"> No, you cant

<name="tyrion"> No
<name="shae"> You look like youre in agony The fire is burning your pretty soft skin
<name="tyrion"> Ah! Damn you, woman Are you immune to pain?
<name="shae"> Just used to it
<name="bronn"> Drink
<name="tyrion"> Lets play a new game
<name="bronn"> Theres a Braavosi knife game l could teach you
<name="tyrion"> Does it involve the potential for losing fingers?
<name="bronn"> Not if you win
<name="tyrion"> No! No fire games, no knife games Lets do something lm good at
<name="shae"> What are you good at?
<name="tyrion"> l happen to be a great judge of character
<name="bronn"> This sounds like a boring game
<name="tyrion"> lts not Heres how it works l make a statement about your past lf lm right, you drink lf lm wrong, l drink And no lying lll know if youre lying
<name="shae"> l dont want to play this game
<name="tyrion"> Fine first Your father beat you
<name="bronn"> But my mother hit harder
<name="tyrion"> You killed your first man before you were 12
<name="bronn"> lt was a woman She swung an axe at me
<name="tyrion"> Youve been north of the Wall
<name="shae"> What brought you up there?
<name="bronn"> Work
<name="tyrion"> And you once loved a woman many years ago, but it turned out badly so youve never let yourself love again Oh, wait, thats me Your turn, my mysterious foreign beauty
<name="shae"> l dont want to play
<name="tyrion"> lts fun! Look at the fun were having Your mother was a whore
<name="shae"> Drink
<name="tyrion"> All right Your father left the family when you were very young, never to return
<name="shae"> Drink
<name="tyrion"> And weve established the rules about lying?
<name="shae"> Drink
<name="tyrion"> You wanted a different life You came from somewhere and you wanted to be elsewhere
<name="bronn"> The whole shit-stained world could drink off that one
<name="tyrion"> So, specifics You wanted to be elsewhere, but how would you get there? l dont believe the life of the Silent Sisters is for you So, whats a lowborn girl to do?
<name="shae"> Drink
<name="tyrion"> Are you sure
<name="shae"> Drink! And dont talk about my mother and father ever, or l will carve your eyes from your head
<name="tyrion"> My dear lady, if l have offended you, l apologize
<name="shae"> My turn
<name="tyrion"> Fine, fine Ask away Try to penetrate the enigma that is me
<name="shae"> Who were you in love with?
<name="tyrion"> Thats not how the game works
<name="shae"> l dont care the way the game works
<name="bronn"> Our lord here used to be married
<name="shae"> Married?
<name="tyrion"> How did you hear that?
<name="bronn"> You hear lots of things playing dice with Lannister soldiers
<name="tyrion"> Another night, perhaps
<name="shae"> Not another night This night
<name="tyrion"> lts not a pleasant story
<name="shae"> Oh, maybe l will cry
<name="bronn"> lm guessing the lady and l can tell more unpleasant stories than your lordship
<name="tyrion"> So l was 16 My brother Jaime and l were riding, when we heard a scream She ran out onto the road, clothes half torn off, with two men on her heels Jaime scared away the men easily enough, while l wrapped her in my cloak She was too scared to send off on her own, so while Jaime hunted down the rapers l took her to the nearest inn and fed her Her name was Tysha She was a wheelwrights orphan And she was hungry Together we finished off three chickens and a flagon of wine lmpossible as it seems, there was a time when l was unaccustomed to wine l forgot how afraid l was around girls how l was always waiting for them to laugh at me or look away embarrassed, or ask me about my tall, handsome brother l forgot about everything but Tysha And somehow l found myself in her bed
<name="bronn"> For three chickens, l should hope so
<name="tyrion"> lt didnt last long l didnt know what the hell l was doing But she was good to me She kissed me afterwards and sang me a song And by morning l was deep enough in love to ask for her hand A few lies, a few gold coins, one drunken septon and there you have it man and wife For a fortnight anyway, until the septon sobered up and told my father
<name="bronn"> Well, l imagine that was the end of all that
<name="tyrion"> Not quite First, my father had Jaime tell me the truth The girl was a whore, you see Jaime had arranged the whole thing the road, the rapers, all of it He thought it was time l had a woman After my brother confessed, my father brought in my wife and gave her to his guards He paid her well a silver for each man How many whores command that kind of price? He brought me into the barracks and made me watch By the end, she had so much silver that the coins were slipping through her fingers and rolling on to the floor
<name="bronn"> l would have killed the man who did that to me
<name="shae"> You should have known she was a whore
<name="tyrion"> Really? l was 16, drunk and in love
<name="shae"> A girl who was almost raped doesnt invite another man into her bed two hours later
<name="tyrion"> As l said, l was young and stupid
<name="shae"> You are still young and stupid
<name="tyrion"> What is it? What do you want?
<name="bronn"> Youre sleeping through the war
<name="tyrion"> What?
<name="bronn"> They stole a nights march on us Theyre a mile north
<name="tyrion"> Get my squire
<name="bronn"> You dont have a squire
<name="tyrion"> lf l die, weep for me
<name="shae"> Youll be dead How will you know?
<name="tyrion"> lll know
<name="soldier"> Watch out! Move
<name="soldier"> Out of the way! Move aside
<name="bronn"> Stay low
<name="tyrion"> Stay low?
<name="bronn"> lf youre lucky, no one will notice you
<name="tyrion"> l was born lucky Tribesmen of the Vale, gather round! Stone Crows! Black Ears! Burned Men! Moon Brothers! And Painted Dogs! Your dominion over the Vale begins now! Onward, to claim what is yours! Tribesmen of the Vale Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man
<name="tyrion"> To battle
<name="bronn"> Youre a shit warrior
<name="tyrion"> lm alive?
<name="bronn"> Youre alive
<name="tyrion"> Did we win?
<name="bronn"> We wouldnt be having this conversation if we didnt
<name="tyrion"> How did our tribesmen do?
<name="bronn"> Yeah, good
<name="tyrion"> lts nice to see them getting along
<name="tywin"> Youre wounded
<name="tyrion"> Good of you to notice l hear we won
<name="tywin"> Huh! The scouts were wrong There were 2,000 Stark bannermen, not 20
<name="tyrion"> Did we get the Stark boy, at least?
<name="tywin"> He wasnt here
<name="tyrion"> Where was he?
<name="tywin"> With his other 18,000 men
<name="tyrion"> And where are they? -
<name="rodrik cassel"> We should go, my lady
<name="catelyn"> No
<name="rodrik cassel"> My lady
<name="bannermen"> Hyah! Hyah
<name="robb"> By the time they knew what was happening, it had already happened
<name="jaime"> Lady Stark ld offer you my sword, but l seem to have lost it
<name="catelyn"> lt is not your sword l want Give me my daughters back Give me my husband
<name="jaime"> lve lost them too, lm afraid
<name="theon"> Kill him, Robb Send his head to his father He cut down ten of our men You saw him
<name="robb"> Hes more use to us alive than dead
<name="catelyn"> Take him away and put him in irons
<name="jaime"> We could end this war right now, boy, save thousands of lives You fight for the Starks, l fight for the Lannisters Swords or lances, teeth, nails choose your weapons and lets end this here and now
<name="robb"> lf we do it your way, Kingslayer, youd win Were not doing it your way
<name="greatjon umber"> Come on, pretty man
<name="robb"> l sent 2,000 men to their graves today
<name="theon"> The bards will sing songs of their sacrifice
<name="robb"> Aye But the dead wont hear them One victory does not make us conquerors Did we free my father? Did we rescue my sisters from the queen? Did we free the North from those who want us on our knees? This war is far from over
<name="arya"> Could l have one? A lemon one or any of them.King

<name="eddark"> Baelor
<name="populace"> Traitor! Traitor
<name="eddark"> I am Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Hand of the King I come before you to confess my treason in the sight of Gods and men I betrayed the faith of my King and the trust of my friend Robert I swore to protect and defend his children, but before his blood was cold I plotted to murder his son and seize the Throne for myself Let the High Septon and Baelor the Blessed bear witness to what I say Joffrey Baratheon is the one true heir to the Iron Throne, by the grace of all the Gods, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm
<name="grand maester pycelle"> As we sin, so do we suffer This man has confessed his crimes in sight of Gods and men The Gods are just but beloved Baelor taught us they can also be merciful What is to be done with this traitor, Your Grace?
<name="joffrey"> My mother wishes me to let Lord Eddard join The Nights Watch Stripped of all titles and powers, he would serve the realm in permanent exile And My Lady Sansa has begged mercy for her father But they have the soft hearts of women So long as I am your King, treason shall never go unpunished Ser Ilyn, bring me his head
<name="sansa"> No, stop! Please, someone stop him

<name="tyrion"> Then Im not a dwarf My father will rejoice to hear it I have a gift for you Give that to your saddler Hell provide the rest You must shape the horse to the rider Start with a yearling and teach it to respond to the reins and to the boys voice
<name="bran"> Will I really be able to ride?
<name="tyrion"> You will On horseback you will be as tall as any of them
<name="robb"> Is this some kind of trick? Why do you want to help him?

<name="theon"> She wasnt feeling well
<name="tyrion"> Shes not in Winterfell, is she? Where did she go?
<name="theon"> My ladys whereabouts.
<name="tyrion"> My lady? Your loyalty to your captors is touching Tell me, how do you think Balon Greyjoy would feel if he could see his only surviving son has turned lackey? I still remember seeing my fathers fleet burn in Lannisport I believe your uncles were responsible?
<name="theon"> Must have been a pretty sight
<name="tyrion"> Nothing prettier than watching sailors burn alive Yes, a great victory for your people Shame how it all turned out
<name="theon"> We were outnumbered 10 to one
<name="tyrion"> A stupid rebellion then I suppose your father realized that when your brothers died in battle Now here you are, your enemys squire
<name="theon"> Careful, Imp
<name="tyrion"> Ive offended you Forgive me, its been a rough morning Anyway, dont despair Im a constant disappointment to my own father and Ive learned to live with it Your next tumble with Ros is on me Ill try not to wear her out -

<name="grenn"> Come on here! -
<name="jorah"> Vaes Dothrak The city of the horselords
<name="viserys"> A pile of mud Mud and shit and twigs best these savages can do
<name="daenerys"> These are my people now You shouldnt call them savages
<name="viserys"> Ill call them what I like, because theyre my people This is my army Khal Drogo is marching the wrong way with my army
<name="daenerys"> If my brother was given an army of Dothraki, could you conquer the Seven Kingdoms?
<name="jorah"> The Dothraki have never crossed the Narrow Sea They fear any water their horses cant drink
<name="daenerys"> But if they did?
<name="jorah"> King Robert is fool enough to meet them in open battle, but the men advising him are different
<name="daenerys"> And you know these men?
<name="jorah"> I fought beside them once, long ago Now Ned Stark wants my head He drove me from my land
<name="daenerys"> You sold slaves
<name="jorah"> Aye
<name="daenerys"> Why?
<name="jorah"> I had no money and an expensive wife
<name="daenerys"> And where is she now?
<name="jorah"> In another place, with another man -
<name="doreah"> Your Grace?
<name="viserys"> Yes, my dear?
<name="doreah"> They call you the last dragon.
<name="viserys"> They do
<name="doreah"> You have dragons blood in your veins?
<name="viserys"> Its entirely possible
<name="doreah"> What happened to the dragons? I was told that brave men killed them all
<name="viserys"> The brave men didnt kill dragons The brave men rode them Rode them from Valyria to build the greatest civilization this world has ever seen The breath of the greatest dragon forged the Iron Throne, which the Usurper is keeping warm for me The swords of the vanquished, a thousand of them melted together like so many candles
<name="doreah"> I have always wanted to see a dragon There is nothing in the world that I would rather see
<name="viserys"> Really? Why dragons?
<name="doreah"> They can fly And wherever they are, just a few flaps of their wings and theyre somewhere else Far away And they can kill Anyone or anything that tries to hurt them gets burned away to nothing melted like so many candles Seeing a dragon would make me very happy
<name="viserys"> Well, after 15 years in a pleasure house, I imagine just seeing the sky makes you happy
<name="doreah"> I was not locked in I have seen things
<name="viserys"> What have you seen?
<name="doreah"> Ive seen A man from Asshai with a dagger of real dragonglass Ive seen a man who could change his face the way that other men change their clothes And Ive seen a pirate who wore his weight in gold and whose ship had sails of colored silk So Have you seen one?
<name="viserys"> A pirate ship?
<name="doreah"> A dragon
<name="viserys"> No, the last one died many years before I was born Ill tell you what I have seen their skulls They used to decorate the throne room in the Red Keep When I was very young, just 3 or 4, my father used to walk me down the rows and Id recite their names for him When I got them all right, hed give me a sweet The ones closest to the door were the last ones they were able to hatch and they were all stunted and wrong Skulls no bigger than dog skulls But as you got closer to the Iron Throne They got bigger and bigger and bigger There was Ghiscar and Valryon, Vermithrax, Essovius, Archonel, Meraxes, Vhagar And Balerion the Dread whose fire forged the Seven Kingdoms into one
<name="doreah"> What happened to the skulls?
<name="viserys"> I dont know The Usurper had them smashed to powder, I expect Scattered to the wind
<name="doreah"> Thats very sad
<name="viserys"> Yes, it is What did I buy you for? To make me sad?
<name="doreah"> No, your Grace To teach your sister
<name="viserys"> To teach my sister how to be a better lover? You think I bought you to make Khal Drogo happy? You pretty little idiot Go on then Get on with it -
<name="septa mordane"> Someday your husband will sit there and you will sit by his side And one day, before too long, you will present your son to the court All the lords of Westeros will gather here to see the little prince.
<name="sansa"> What if I have a girl?
<name="septa mordane"> Gods be good, youll have boys and girls and plenty of them
<name="sansa"> What if I only have girls?
<name="septa mordane"> I wouldnt worry about that
<name="sansa"> Jeyne Pooles mother had five children, all of them girls
<name="septa mordane"> Yes, but its highly unlikely
<name="sansa"> But what if?
<name="septa mordane"> If you only had girls, I suppose the throne would pass to Prince Joffreys little brother
<name="sansa"> And everyone would hate me
<name="septa mordane"> Nobody could ever hate you
<name="sansa"> Joffrey does
<name="septa mordane"> Nonsense Why would you say such a thing? That business with the wolves? Ive told you a hundred times A direwolf is not.
<name="sansa"> Please shut up about it
<name="septa mordane"> Do you remember your lessons? Who built the Iron Throne?
<name="sansa"> Aegon the Conqueror
<name="septa mordane"> And who built the Red Keep?
<name="sansa"> Maegor the Cruel
<name="septa mordane"> And how many years did it take to build.
<name="sansa"> My grandfather and uncle were murdered here, werent they?
<name="septa mordane"> They were killed on the orders of King Aerys, yes
<name="sansa"> The Mad King
<name="septa mordane"> Commonly known as the Mad King
<name="sansa"> Why were they killed?
<name="septa mordane"> You should speak to your father about these matters
<name="sansa"> I dont want to speak to my father, ever
<name="septa mordane"> You will find it in your heart to forgive your father
<name="sansa"> No, I wont -
<name="janos slynt"> Its the Hands tournament thats causing all this trouble, my Lords
<name="ned"> ings tournament I assure you the Hand wants no part of it
<name="janos slynt"> Call it what you will, Lord Stark Ser, the city is packed with people and more flooding in every day Last night we had a tavern riot, a brothel fire, three stabbings and a drunken horse race down the Street of Sisters
<name="varys"> Dreadful
<name="renly"> If you cant keep the Kings peace, perhaps the City Watch should be commanded by someone who can
<name="janos slynt"> I need more men
<name="ned"> Youll get 50 Lord Baelish will see it paid for
<name="littlefinger"> I will?
<name="ned"> You found money for a champions purse, you can find money to keep the peace Ill also give you 20 of my household guards till the crowds have left
<name="janos slynt"> Thank you, my Lord Hand Ser They will be put to good use
<name="ned"> The sooner this is over, the better
<name="varys"> The realm prospers from such events, my Lord They give the great a chance at glory, and the lowly a respite from their woes
<name="littlefinger"> And every inn in the city is full and the whores are walking bow-legged
<name="ned"> Im sure the tourney puts coins in many a pocket Now If theres nothing else, my Lords?
<name="grand maester pycelle"> This heat On days like this, I envy you northerners your summer snows Until tomorrow my Lord
<name="ned"> Ive been hoping to talk to you about Jon Arryn
<name="grand maester pycelle"> Lord Arryn? His death was a great sadness to all of us I took personal charge of his care, but I could not save him His sickness struck him very hard and very fast I saw him in my chambers just the night before he passed Lord Jon often came to me for counsel
<name="ned"> Why?
<name="grand maester pycelle"> I have been Grand Maester for many years Kings and Hands have come to me for advice since.
<name="ned"> What did Jon want the night before he died?
<name="grand maester pycelle"> He came inquiring after a book
<name="ned"> A book? What book?
<name="grand maester pycelle"> I fear it would be of little interest to you, my Lord A ponderous tome
<name="ned"> Id like to read it
<name="grand maester pycelle"> The lineages and histories of the great houses of the Seven Kingdoms, with descriptions of many high lords and noble ladies and their children
<name="ned"> Harkon Umber, first of his name, born to lord Hother Umber and lady Amaryllis Umber in the 183rd year after Aegons landing, at the last hearth Blue of eye, brown of hair and fair complected, died in his 14th year of a wound sustained in a bear hunt
<name="grand maester pycelle"> As I said, my Lord, a ponderous read
<name="ned"> Did Jon Arryn tell you what he wanted with it?
<name="grand maester pycelle"> He did not, my Lord And I did not presume to ask
<name="ned"> Jons death.
<name="grand maester pycelle"> Such a tragedy
<name="ned"> Did he say anything to you during his final hours?
<name="grand maester pycelle"> Nothing of import, my Lord There was one phrase he kept repeating The seed is strong, I think it was
<name="ned"> The seed is strong ? What does that mean?
<name="grand maester pycelle"> The dying mind is a demented mind, Lord Stark For all the weight theyre given, last words are usually as significant as first words
<name="ned"> And youre quite certain he died of a natural illness?
<name="grand maester pycelle"> What else could it be?
<name="ned"> Poison
<name="grand maester pycelle"> A disturbing thought I dont think it likely The Hand was loved by all What sort of man would dare.
<name="ned"> Ive heard it said that poison is a womans weapon
<name="grand maester pycelle"> Yes Women, cravens and eunuchs Did you know that lord Varys is a eunuch?
<name="ned"> Everybody knows that
<name="grand maester pycelle"> Yes, yes, of course How that sort of person found himself on the Kings Council, I will never know
<name="ned"> Ive taken enough of your time
<name="grand maester pycelle"> No trouble at all, my Lord Its a great honor.
<name="ned"> Thank you Ill find my own way out -
<name="arya"> Syrio says a water dancer can stand on one toe for hours
<name="ned"> Its a hard fall down these steps
<name="arya"> Syrio says every hurt is a lesson and every lesson makes you better Tomorrow Im going to be chasing cats
<name="ned"> Cats? Syrio says
<name="arya"> He says every swordsman should study cats Theyre quiet as shadows and as light as feathers You have to be quick to catch them
<name="ned"> Hes right about that
<name="arya"> Now that Brans awake will he come live with us?
<name="ned"> He needs to get his strength back first
<name="arya"> He wants to be a knight of the King’s Guard He cant be one now, can he?
<name="ned"> No But someday he could be Lord of a holdfast or sit on the Kings Council Or he might raise castles like Brandon the Builder
<name="arya"> Can I be Lord of a holdfast?
<name="ned"> You will marry a high Lord and rule his castle And your sons shall be knights and princes and lords
<name="arya"> No Thats not me -
<name="sam"> Hello Ser Alliser said Im to be your new watch partner I should warn you, I dont see all that well
<name="jon"> Come stand by the fire Its warmer
<name="sam"> No, thats all right Im fine
<name="jon"> Youre not Youre freezing
<name="sam"> I dont like high places
<name="jon"> You cant fight You cant see Youre afraid of heights and almost everything else probably What are you doing here, Sam?
<name="sam"> On the morning of my 18th nameday, my father came to me Youre almost a man now, he said, but youre not worthy of my land and title Tomorrow, youre going to take the black, forsake all claim to your inheritance and start north If you do not, he said, then well have a hunt and somewhere in these woods your horse will stumble and youll be thrown from your saddle to die Or so Ill tell your mother Nothing would please me more Ser Allisers going to make me fight again tomorrow, isnt he?
<name="jon"> Yes, he is
<name="sam"> Im not going to get any better, you know?
<name="jon"> Well You cant get any worse -
<name="littlefinger"> I hear youre reading a boring book
<name="ned"> Pycelle talks too much
<name="littlefinger"> He never stops Do you know Ser Hugh of the Vale? Not surprising Until recently, he was only a squire Jon Arryns squire He was knighted almost immediately after his masters untimely death
<name="ned"> Knighted for what? Why are you telling me this?
<name="littlefinger"> I promised Cat that Id help you
<name="ned"> Where is Ser Hugh? Ill speak to him
<name="littlefinger"> A singularly bad idea Do you see that boy there? One of Varyss little birds The Spider has taken a great interest in your comings and goings Now look there That one belongs to the Queen And do you see that Septa pretending to read her book?
<name="ned"> Varys or the Queen?
<name="littlefinger"> No Shes one of mine Is there someone in your service whom you trust completely?
<name="ned"> Yes
<name="littlefinger"> The wiser answer was no, my Lord Get a message to this paragon of yours Discreetly Send him to question Ser Hugh After that, you might want him to visit a certain armorer in the city He lives in a large house at the top of the street of Steel
<name="ned"> Why?
<name="littlefinger"> I have my observers, as I said, and its possible that they saw Lord Arryn visit this armorer several times in the weeks before his death
<name="ned"> Lord Baelish, perhaps I was wrong to distrust you
<name="littlefinger"> Distrusting me was the wisest thing youve done since you climbed off your horse -
<name="jory cassel"> Ser Hugh? Ser Hugh
<name="hugh of the vale"> As you can see, Im busy
<name="jory cassel"> Im here on behalf of Lord Eddard Stark, the Hand of the king Im the captain of his guard
<name="hugh of the vale"> Im sorry I didnt catch your name, Ser.
<name="jory cassel"> No ser Im not a knight
<name="hugh of the vale"> I see Well, it just so happens that I am -
<name="jory cassel"> He said hed be glad to talk to the Hand himself Hes a knight, you see
<name="ned"> A knight They strut around like roosters down here Even the ones whove never seen an arrow coming their way
<name="jory cassel"> You shouldnt be out here, my Lord Theres no telling who has eyes where
<name="ned"> Let them look
<name="tobho mott"> The former Hand did call on me, my Lord, several times I regret to say he did not honor me with his patronage
<name="ned"> What did Lord Arryn want?
<name="tobho mott"> He always came to see the boy
<name="ned"> Id like to see him as well
<name="tobho mott"> As you wish, my Lord Gendry! Here he is Strong for his age He works hard Show the Hand the helmet you made, lad
<name="ned"> This is fine work
<name="gendry"> Its not for sale
<name="tobho mott"> Boy, this is the Kings Hand! If his lordship wants the helmet.
<name="gendry"> I made it for me
<name="tobho mott"> Forgive him, my Lord
<name="ned"> Theres nothing to forgive When Lord Arryn came to visit you, what would you talk about?
<name="gendry"> He just asked me questions is all, my Lord
<name="ned"> What kind of questions?
<name="gendry"> About my work at first, if I was being treated well, if I liked it here But then he started asking me about my mother
<name="ned"> Your mother?
<name="gendry"> Who she was, what she looked like
<name="ned"> What did you tell him?
<name="gendry"> She died when I was little She had yellow hair Shed sing to me sometimes
<name="ned"> Look at me Get back to work, lad If the day ever comes when that boyd rather wield a sword than forge one, you send him to me
<name="jory cassel"> Find anything?
<name="ned"> King Roberts bastard son -
<name="jory cassel"> This is for the King from Lord Stark
<name="jaime"> Listen Do you hear them? How many do you think are in there with him? Guess
<name="jory cassel"> Three? Four?
<name="jaime"> He likes to do this when Im on duty He makes me listen as he insults my sister
<name="jory cassel"> Forgive me, my Lord.
<name="jaime"> Why do I have to forgive you? Have you wronged me?
<name="jory cassel"> Weve met before, you know
<name="jaime"> Have we? Strange, Ive forgotten
<name="jory cassel"> The siege of Pyke We fought side by side one afternoon
<name="jaime"> Thats where you got your scar?
<name="jory cassel"> Aye One of the Greyjoys nearly took my eye
<name="jaime"> Vicious sons of whores
<name="jory cassel"> They like their bloodshed
<name="jaime"> They stopped liking it at the end That was a proper battle Dyou remember Thoros of Myr charging through the breach?
<name="jory cassel"> With his burning sword? Ill remember that till the day I die
<name="jaime"> I saw the youngest of the Greyjoy lads at Winterfell It was like seeing a shark on a mountaintop
<name="jory cassel"> Theon? Hes a good lad
<name="jaime"> I doubt it
<name="robert"> Ill bet you smell of blackberry jam! Let me smell it Come here
<name="jory cassel"> Can I leave this with you? The message from Lord Stark
<name="jaime"> I dont serve Lord Stark -
<name="grenn"> Where have you been?
<name="jon"> Watch duty With Sam
<name="pyp"> Prince Porkchop Where is he?
<name="jon"> He wasnt hungry
<name="pyp"> Impossible
<name="jon"> Thats enough Sams no different from the rest of us There was no place for him in the world, so hes come here Were not going to hurt him in the training yard anymore Never again, no matter what Thorne says Hes our brother now and were going to protect him
<name="rast"> You are in love, Lord Snow You girls can do as you please But if Thorne puts me up against Lady Piggy, Im gonna slice me off a side of bacon.All of the new recruits are sleeping Jon, Ghost , Pyp and Grenn ambush and gag Rast as he sleeps Jon threatens him
<name="jon"> No one touches Sam
<name="alliser thorne"> What are you waiting for? Attack him! You, get in there
<name="grenn"> Hit me Go on, hit me! I yield! Yield yield I yield
<name="alliser thorne"> You think this is funny, do you? When youre out there beyond the Wall with the sun going down, do you want a man at your back? Or a sniveling boy? -
<name="viserys"> You send this whore to give me commands? I should have sent you back her head
<name="doreah"> Forgive me, Khaleesi I did as you asked
<name="daenerys"> Hush now Its all right , take her and leave us
<name="irri"> Yes, Khaleesi
<name="daenerys"> Why did you hit her?
<name="viserys"> How many times do I have to tell you? You do not command me
<name="daenerys"> I wasnt commanding you I just wanted to invite you to supper
<name="viserys"> Whats this?
<name="daenerys"> Its a gift I had it made for you
<name="viserys"> Dothraki rags? Are you going to dress me now?
<name="daenerys"> Please
<name="viserys"> This stinks of manure All of it
<name="daenerys"> Stop stop it
<name="viserys"> You would turn me into one of them, wouldnt you? Next youll want to braid my hair
<name="daenerys"> Youve no right to a braid Youve won no victories yet
<name="viserys"> You do not talk back to me
<name="viserys"> You are a horselords slut And now youve woken the dragon.
<name="daenerys"> I am a Khaleesi of the Dothraki! I am the wife of the great Khal and I carry his son inside me The next time you raise a hand to me will be the last time you have hands -
<name="sam"> I know for a fact that some of the officers go to that brothel in Moles Town
<name="jon"> I wouldnt doubt it
<name="sam"> Dont you think its a little bit unfair? Making us take our vows while they sneak off for a little sally on the side?
<name="jon"> Sally on the side?
<name="sam"> Its silly, isnt it? What, we cant defend the Wall unless were celibate? Its absurd
<name="jon"> I didnt think youd be so upset about it
<name="sam"> Why not? Because Im fat? But I like girls just as much as you do They might not like me as much Ive never been with one Youve probably had hundreds
<name="jon"> As a matter of fact, Im the same as you
<name="sam"> I find that hard to believe
<name="jon"> I came very close once I was alone in a room with a naked girl, but.
<name="sam"> You didnt know where to put it?
<name="jon"> I know where to put it
<name="sam"> Was she Old and ugly?
<name="jon"> Young and gorgeous A whore named Ros
<name="sam"> What color hair?
<name="jon"> Red
<name="sam"> I like red hair And her Her.
<name="jon"> You dont want to know
<name="sam"> That good?
<name="jon"> Better
<name="sam"> Oh no So why exactly did you not make love to Ros with the perfect.
<name="jon"> Whats my name?
<name="sam"> ?
<name="jon"> And why is my surname Snow?
<name="sam"> Because Youre a bastard from the north
<name="jon"> I never met my mother My father wouldnt even tell me her name I dont know if shes living or dead I dont know if shes a noblewoman or a fishermans wife Or a whore So I sat there in the brothel as Ros took off her clothes But I couldnt do it Because all I could think was what if I got her pregnant and she had a child, another bastard named Snow? Its not a good life for a child
<name="sam"> So You didnt know where to put it?
<name="alliser thorne"> Enjoying yourselves? You look cold, boys
<name="sam"> It is a bit nippy
<name="alliser thorne"> A bit nippy, yeah, by the fire, indoors Its still summer Do you boys even remember the last winter? How long has it been now? What, 10 years? I remember Was it uncomfortable at Winterfell? Were there days when you just couldnt get warm, never mind how many fires your servants built?
<name="jon"> I build my own fires
<name="alliser thorne"> Thats admirable I spent six months out there, beyond the Wall during the last winter It was supposed to be a two-week mission We heard a rumor Mance Rayder was planning to attack Eastwatch So we went out to look for some of his men Capture them, gather some knowledge The Wildlings who fight for Mance Rayder are hard men Harder than youll ever be They know their country better than we do They knew there was a storm coming in So they hid in their caves and waited for it to pass And we got caught in the open Wind so strong it yanked 100-foot trees straight from the ground, roots and all If you took your gloves off to find your cock to have a piss, you lost a finger to the frost And all in darkness You dont know cold Neither of you do The horses died first We didnt have enough to feed them, to keep them warm Eating the horses was easy But later when we started to fall That wasnt easy We should have had a couple of boys like you along, shouldnt we? Soft, fat boys like you Wed have lasted a fortnight on you and still had bones leftover for soup Soon well have new recruits and you lot will be passed along to the Lord Commander for assignment and they will call you men of the Nights Watch, but youd be fools to believe it Youre boys still And come the winter you will die Like flies -
<name="daenerys"> I hit him I hit the dragon
<name="jorah"> Your brother Rhaegar was the last dragon Viserys is less than the shadow of a snake
<name="daenerys"> He is still the true King
<name="jorah"> The truth now do you want to see your brother sitting on the Iron Throne?
<name="daenerys"> No But the common people are waiting for him Illyrio said theyre sewing dragon banners and praying for his return
<name="jorah"> The common people pray for rain, health and a summer that never ends They dont care what games the high Lords play
<name="daenerys"> What do you pray for, Ser Jorah?
<name="jorah"> Home
<name="daenerys"> I pray for home too My brother will never take back the Seven Kingdoms He couldnt lead an army even if my husband gave him one Hell never take us home -
<name="littlefinger"> Lovers quarrel?
<name="sansa"> Im sorry Do I ?
<name="septa mordane"> Sansa dear, this is Lord Baelish Hes known.
<name="littlefinger"> An old friend of the family Ive known your mother a long long time
<name="arya"> Why do they call you Littlefinger?
<name="sansa"> Arya
<name="septa mordane"> Dont be rude
<name="littlefinger"> No, its quite all right When I was a child I was very small and I come from a little spit of land called The Fingers, so you see, its an exceedingly clever nickname
<name="robert"> Ive been sitting here for days! Start the damn joust before I piss myself
<name="sansa"> Gods, who is that?
<name="littlefinger"> Ser Gregor Clegane They call him the Mountain The Hounds older brother
<name="sansa"> And his opponent?
<name="littlefinger"> Ser Hugh of the Vale He was Jon Arryns squire Look how far hes come
<name="robert"> Yes, yes Enough of the bloody pomp Have at it
<name="littlefinger"> Not what you were expecting? Has anyone ever told you the story of the Mountain and the Hound? Lovely little tale of brotherly love The Hound was just a pup, six years old maybe Gregor a few years older, already a big lad, already getting a bit of a reputation Some lucky boys just born with a talent for violence One evening Gregor found his little brother playing with a toy by the fire Gregors toy, a wooden knight Gregor never said a word, he just grabbed his brother by the scruff of his neck and shoved his face into the burning coals Held him there while the boy screamed, while his face melted There arent very many people who know that story
<name="sansa"> I wont tell anyone I promise
<name="littlefinger"> No, please dont If the Hound so much as heard you mention it, Im afraid all the knights in Kings Landing would not be able to save you -
<name="jory cassel"> My Lord, Her Grace the Queen
<name="ned"> Your Grace
<name="cersei"> Youre missing your tournament
<name="ned"> Putting my name on it doesnt make it mine
<name="cersei"> I thought we might put what happened on the Kingsroad behind us – the ugliness with the wolves And forcing you to kill the beast was extreme Though sometimes we go to extremes where our children are concerned How is Sansa?
<name="ned"> She likes it here
<name="cersei"> The only Stark who does Favors her mother, not much of the north in her
<name="ned"> What are you doing here?
<name="cersei"> I might ask the same of you What is it you hope to accomplish?
<name="ned"> ing called on me to serve him and the realm, and thats what Ill do until he tells me otherwise
<name="cersei"> You cant change him You cant help him Hell do what he wants, which is all hes ever done Youll try your best to pick up the pieces
<name="ned"> If thats my job, then so be it
<name="cersei"> Youre just a soldier, arent you? You take your orders and you carry on I suppose it makes sense Your older brother was trained to lead and you were trained to follow
<name="ned"> I was also trained to kill my enemies, Your Grace
<name="cersei"> As was I -
<name="marillion"> Seven blessings to you, goodfolk
<name="catelyn"> And to you
<name="rodrick cassel"> Boy! Bread, meat and beer, quickly

<name="rodrick cassel"> Id rather throw myself down a well
<name="marillion"> Grandfather, may be your last chance if youre heading north The only music the northerners know is the howling of wolves
<name="masha heddle"> Im sorry, my Lord, were full up Every room
<name="tyrion"> My men can sleep in the stable As for myself, I dont require a large room
<name="masha heddle"> Truly, my lord, we have nothing

<name="masha heddle"> Lady Stark
<name="catelyn"> I was still Catelyn Tully the last time I stayed here You, Ser Is that the black bat of Harrenhal I see embroidered on your coat?
<name="knight of house whent"> It is, my Lady
<name="catelyn"> And is Lady Whent a true and honest friend to my father Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun?

<name="jaime"> Let me show you how Hit me again, over the ear And again and again Youre stronger than you look, it shouldnt take long
<name="catelyn"> That is what you want the world to believe, isnt it? That you dont fear death
<name="jaime"> But l dont, my lady The dark is coming for all of us Why cry about it?
<name="catelyn"> Because you are going to the deepest of the seven hells, if the gods are just
<name="jaime"> What gods are those? The trees your husband prayed to? Where were the trees when his head was getting chopped off? lf your gods are real and if they are just why is the world so full of injustice?
<name="catelyn"> Because of men like you

<name="tyrion"> The Stark boy appears to be less green than wed hoped
<name="leo lefford"> lve heard his wolf killed a dozen men and as many horses
<name="addam marbrand"> ls it true about Stannis and Renly?
<name="kevan"> Both Baratheon brothers have taken up against us Jaime captured, his armies scattered lts a catastrophe Perhaps we should sue for peace
<name="tyrion"> Theres your peace Joffrey saw to that when he decided to remove Ned Starks head Youll have an easier time drinking from that cup than you will bringing Robb Stark to the table now Hes winning – in case you hadnt noticed
<name="kevan"> lm told we still have his sisters
<name="leo lefford"> The first order of business is ransoming Ser Jaime
<name="kevan"> First we must return to Casterly Rock to raise
<name="tywin"> They have my son! Get out, all of you Not you You were right about Eddard Stark lf he were alive, we could have used him to broker a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun, which would have given us more time to deal with Roberts brothers But now – madness Madness and stupidity l always thought you were a stunted fool Perhaps l was wrong
<name="tyrion"> Half wrong lm new to strategy, but unless we want to be surrounded by three armies, it appears we cant stay here
<name="tywin"> No one will stay here Ser Gregor will head out with 500 riders and set the Riverland on fire from Gods Eye to the Red Fork The rest of us will regroup at Harrenhal And you will go to Kings Landing
<name="tyrion"> And do what?
<name="tywin"> Rule You will serve as Hand of the King in my stead You will bring that boy king to heel, and his mother too, if needs be And if you get so much as a whiff of treason from any of the rest – Baelish, Varys, Pycelle

<name="jorah"> They say the child was
<name="mirri maz duur"> Monstrous, twisted l pulled him out myself He was scaled like a lizard, blind, with leather wings like the wings of a bat When l touched him the skin fell from his bones Inside he was full of graveworms l warned you that only death can pay for life You knew the price
<name="daenerys"> Where is Khal Drogo? Show him to me Show me what l bought with my sons life
<name="mirri maz duur"> As you command, lady Come l will take you to him

Three of those riders had already raped me before you saved me, girl l saw my gods house burn, there where l had healed men and women beyond counting ln the streets l saw piles of heads, the head of the baker who makes my bread, the head of a young boy that l had cured of fever just three moons past So tell me again exactly what it was that you saved?
<name="daenerys"> Your life

<name="daenerys"> When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east Then you shall return to me, my sun and stars In King’s Landing, Pycelle is having a conversation with someone in his bedchambers
<name="grand maester pycelle"> Kings? Oh, l can tell you all there is to know about kings The thing you need to understand about kings is – For the past 67 years, lve known truly known more kings than any man alive Theyre complicated men, but l know how to serve them Yes, and keep on serving them Aerys Targaryen Of all the thousand thousand maladies the Gods visit on us, madness is the worst He was a good man Such a charmer To watch him melt away before my eyes, consumed by dreams of fire and blood Robert Baratheon was an entirely different animal – powerful man, great warrior, but alas winning a kingdom and ruling a kingdom are rather different things They say that if a man goes through life with his battle visor down, he can often be blind to the enemies at his side Now l serve his son King Joffrey, may the Gods bless his reign
<name="grand maester pycelle"> He is a capable young man Strong military mind Stern But sternness in defense of the realm is no vice lts far too soon to know what manner of king he will be, but l sense true greatness on the horizon for our new King Mmm True greatness
<name="ros"> So whats the thing?
<name="grand maester pycelle"> What thing?
<name="ros"> About kings You said, The thing you need to understand about kings
<name="grand maester pycelle"> What? Things? What?

<name="ros"> lts all right No need
<name="grand maester pycelle"> Yes, yes Till the next time Right
<name="varys"> When you imagine yourself up there, how do you look? Does the crown fit? Do all the lords and ladies simper and bow, the ones who sneered at you for years?
<name="littlefinger"> lts hard for them to simper and bow without heads
<name="varys"> A man with great ambition and no morals l wouldnt bet against you
<name="littlefinger"> And what would you do, my friend, if you found yourself sitting up there?
<name="varys"> l must be one of the few men in this city who doesnt want to be King
<name="littlefinger"> You must be one of the few men in the city who isnt a man
<name="varys"> Oh, you can do better than that
<name="littlefinger"> When they castrated you, did they take the pillar with the stones? lve always wondered
<name="varys"> Have you? Do you spend a lot of time wondering whats between my legs?
<name="littlefinger"> l picture a gash Like a womans ls that about right?
<name="varys"> l am flattered, of course, to be pictured at all
<name="littlefinger"> Must be strange for you, even after all these years a man from another land, despised by most, feared by all
<name="varys"> Am l? That is good to know Do you lie awake at night fearing my gash?
<name="littlefinger"> But you carry on whispering in one kings ear and then the next l admire you
<name="varys"> And l admire you, Lord Baelish A grasper from a minor House with a major talent for befriending powerful men – and women
<name="littlefinger"> A useful talent, lm sure youd agree
<name="varys"> So here we stand in mutual admiration and respect

EPISODE "LORD SNOW" - 01/05/2011


<name="landing guard"> Welcome, Lord Stark Grand Maester Pycelle has called a meeting of the Small Council The honor of your presence is requested
<name="ned"> Get the girls settled in Ill be back in time for supper And, Jory, you go with them
<name="jory cassel"> Yes, my Lord.King
<name="landing guard"> If youd like to change into something more appropriate
<name="jaime"> Thank the gods youre here, Stark About time we had some stern northern leadership
<name="ned"> Glad to see youre protecting the throne
<name="jaime"> Sturdy old thing How many kings asses have polished it, I wonder? Whats the line? ing shits and the Hand wipes
<name="ned"> Very handsome armor Not a scratch on it
<name="jaime"> I know People have been swinging at me for years, but they always seem to miss
<name="ned"> Youve chosen your opponents wisely then
<name="jaime"> I have a knack for it It must be strange for you coming into this room I was standing right here when it happened He was very brave, your brother Your father too They didnt deserve to die like that Nobody deserves to die like that
<name="ned"> But you just stood there and watched
<name="jaime"> 500 men just stood there and watched All the great knights of the Seven Kingdoms You think anyone said a word, lifted a finger? No, Lord Stark 500 men and this room was silent as a crypt Except for the screams, of course, and the Mad King laughing And later When I watched the Mad King die, I remembered him laughing as your father burned It felt like justice
<name="ned"> Is that what you tell yourself at night? Youre a servant of justice? That you were avenging my father when you shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryens back?
<name="jaime"> Tell me If Id stabbed the Mad King in the belly instead of the back, would you admire me more?
<name="ned"> You served him well, when serving was safe -
<name="varys"> Lord Stark
<name="ned"> Lord
<name="varys"> I was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles on the Kingsroad We are all praying for Prince Joffreys full recovery
<name="ned"> A shame you didnt say a prayer for the butchers son Renly! Youre looking well
<name="renly"> And you look tired from the road I told them this meeting could wait another day, but.
<name="littlefinger"> But we have a Kingdom to look after Ive hoped to meet you for some time, Lord Stark No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me
<name="ned"> She has, Lord Baelish I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well
<name="littlefinger"> All too well I still carry a token of his esteem from navel to collarbone
<name="ned"> Perhaps you chose the wrong man to duel with
<name="littlefinger"> It wasnt the man that I chose, my Lord It was Catelyn Tully A woman worth fighting for, Im sure youll agree
<name="grand maester pycelle"> I humbly beg your pardon, my Lord Stark
<name="ned"> Grand Maester
<name="grand maester pycelle"> How many years has it been? You were a young man
<name="ned"> And you served another King
<name="grand maester pycelle"> How forgetful of me This belongs to you, now Should we begin?
<name="ned"> Without the King?
<name="renly"> Winter may be coming, but Im afraid the same cannot be said for my brother
<name="varys"> His Grace has many cares He entrusts some small matters to us that we might lighten the load
<name="littlefinger"> We are the lords of small matters here
<name="renly"> My brother instructs us to stage a tournament in honor of Lord Starks appointment as Hand of the King
<name="littlefinger"> Mmm, how much?
<name="ned"> 40,000 gold dragons to the champion, 20,000 to the runner-up, 20,000 to the winning archer
<name="grand maester pycelle"> Can the treasury bear such expense?
<name="littlefinger"> Ill have to borrow it The Lannisters will accommodate, I expect We already owe Lord Tywin 3 million gold Whats another 80,000?
<name="ned"> Are you telling me the Crown is three million in debt?
<name="littlefinger"> Im telling you the Crown is six million in debt
<name="ned"> How could you let this happen?
<name="littlefinger"> The Master of Coin finds the money ing and the Hand spend it
<name="ned"> I will not believe Jon Arryn allowed Robert to bankrupt the realm
<name="grand maester pycelle"> Lord Arryn gave wise and prudent advice, but I fear His Grace doesnt always listen
<name="renly"> Counting coppers, he calls it
<name="ned"> Ill speak to him tomorrow This tournament is an extravagance we cannot afford
<name="littlefinger"> As you will But still, wed best make our plans
<name="ned"> There will be no plans until I speak to Robert Forgive me, my Lords I had a long ride
<name="varys"> You are the Kings Hand, Lord Stark, we serve at your pleasure -
<name="cersei"> Please, its nearly healed
<name="joffrey"> Its ugly
<name="cersei"> A King should have scars, you fought off a direwolf Youre a warrior like your father
<name="joffrey"> Im not like him I didnt fight off anything It bit me and all I did was scream And the two Stark girls saw it, both of them
<name="cersei"> Thats not true You killed the beast You only spared the girl because of the love your father bears her father When Aerys Targaryen sat on the Iron Throne, your father was a rebel and a traitor Someday youll sit on the throne and the truth will be what you make it
<name="joffrey"> Do I have to marry her?
<name="cersei"> Yes Shes very beautiful and young If you dont like her, you only need to see her on formal occasions and when the time comes, to make little princes and princesses And if youd rather fuck painted whores, youll fuck painted whores And if youd rather lie with noble virgins, so be it You are my darling boy and the world will be exactly as you want it to be Do something nice for the Stark girl
<name="joffrey"> I dont want to
<name="cersei"> No, but you will The occasional kindness will spare you all sorts of trouble down the road
<name="joffrey"> We allow the northerners too much power They consider themselves our equals
<name="cersei"> How would you handle them?
<name="joffrey"> Id double their taxes and command them to supply 10,000 men to the royal army
<name="cersei"> A royal army?
<name="joffrey"> Why should every lord command his own men? Its primitive, no better than the hill tribes We should have a standing army of men loyal to the Crown, trained by experienced soldiers Instead of a mob of peasants whove never held pikes in their lives
<name="cersei"> And if the northerners rebel?
<name="joffrey"> Id crush them Seize Winterfell and install someone loyal to the realm as Warden of the North Uncle Kevan, maybe
<name="cersei"> And these 10,000 northern troops, would they fight for you or their lord?
<name="joffrey"> For me Im their King
<name="cersei"> But youve just invaded their homeland, asked them to kill their brothers
<name="joffrey"> Im not asking
<name="cersei"> The North cannot be held not by an outsider Its too big and too wild When the winter comes, the Seven gods together couldnt save you and your royal army A good King knows when to save his strength And when to destroy his enemies
<name="joffrey"> So you agree The Starks are enemies?
<name="cersei"> Everyone who isnt us is an enemy -
<name="septa mordane"> Enough of that, young lady Eat your food
<name="arya"> Im practicing
<name="sansa"> Practicing for what?
<name="arya"> The Prince
<name="septa mordane"> Arya, stop
<name="arya"> Hes a liar and a coward and he killed my friend
<name="sansa"> The Hound killed your friend
<name="arya"> The Hound does whatever the Prince tells him to do
<name="sansa"> Youre an idiot
<name="arya"> Youre a liar And if you told the truth, Mycah would be alive
<name="septa mordane"> Enough
<name="ned"> Whats happening here?
<name="septa mordane"> Arya would rather act like a beast than a lady
<name="ned"> Go to your room Well speak later Thats for you, love
<name="ned"> The same dollmaker makes all of Princess Myrcellas toys Dont you like it?
<name="sansa"> I havent played with dolls since I was eight May I be excused?
<name="septa mordane"> Youve barely eaten a thing
<name="ned"> Its all right Go on
<name="ned"> War was easier than daughters
<name="arya"> Go away
<name="ned"> Arya, open the door May I come in? Whose sword is that?
<name="arya"> Mine
<name="ned"> Give it to me I know this makers mark This is Mikkens work Where did you get this? This is no toy Little ladies shouldnt play with swords
<name="arya"> I wasnt playing And I dont want to be a lady
<name="ned"> Come here Now what do you want with this?
<name="arya"> Its called Needle
<name="ned"> A blade with a name And who were you hoping to skewer with Needle? Your sister? Do you know the first thing about sword fighting?
<name="arya"> Stick em with the pointy end
<name="ned"> Thats the essence of it
<name="arya"> I was trying to learn I asked Mycah to practice with me I asked him It was my fault
<name="ned"> No, sweet girl You didnt kill the butchers boy
<name="arya"> I hate them! I hate all of them The Hound, the Queen and the King and Joffrey and Sansa
<name="ned"> Sansa was dragged before the King and Queen And asked to call the Prince a liar
<name="arya"> So was I! He is a liar
<name="ned"> Darling, listen to me Sansa will be married to Joffrey someday She cannot betray him She must take his side even when hes wrong
<name="arya"> But how you can let her marry someone like that?
<name="ned"> Well Look at me Youre a Stark of Winterfell You know our words
<name="arya"> Winter is coming
<name="ned"> You were born in the long summer Youve never known anything else But now winter is truly coming And in the winter, we must protect ourselves, look after one another Sansa is your sister
<name="arya"> I dont hate her Not really
<name="ned"> I dont want to frighten you, but I wont lie to you either Weve come to a dangerous place We cannot fight a war amongst ourselves All right? Go on Its yours
<name="arya"> I can keep it?
<name="ned"> Try not to stab your sister with it If youre going to own a sword, youd better know how to use it -
<name="old nan"> Dont listen to it Crows are all liars I know a story about a crow
<name="bran"> I hate your stories
<name="old nan"> I know a story about a boy who hated stories I could tell you about Ser Duncan the Tall Those were always your favorites
<name="bran"> Those werent my favorites My favorites were the scary ones
<name="old nan"> Oh, my sweet summer child What do you know about fear? Fear is for the winter, when the snows fall a hundred feet deep Fear is for the long night, when the sun hides for years and children are born and live and die all in darkness That is the time for fear, my little Lord, when the White Walkers move through the woods Thousands of years ago there came a night that lasted a generation Kings froze to death in their castles, same as the shepherds in their huts And women smothered their babies rather than see them starve, and wept and felt the tears freeze on their cheeks So is this the sort of story that you like? In that darkness, the White Walkers came for the first time They swept through cities and kingdoms, riding their dead horses, hunting with their packs of pale spiders big as hounds
<name="robb"> What are you telling him now?
<name="old nan"> Only what the little Lord wants to hear
<name="robb"> Get your supper I want some time with him One time she told me the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant named Macumber
<name="bran"> Maybe we do
<name="robb"> How do you feel? You still dont remember anything? Ive seen you climb a thousand times In the wind, in the rain A thousand times You never fall
<name="bran"> I did though Its true, isnt it what Maester Luwin says about my legs? Id rather be dead
<name="robb"> Dont ever say that
<name="bran"> Id rather be dead -
<name="rodrick cassel"> Fewer eyes back here, my Lady But still too many
<name="catelyn"> Its nine years since Ive set foot in the capital And no one knew who I was the last time I came either
<name="rodrick cassel"> My Lady
<name="guard"> Welcome to Kings Landing, Lady Stark Would you mind following us?
<name="catelyn"> I would Weve done nothing wrong
<name="guard"> Weve been instructed to escort you into the city
<name="catelyn"> Instructed? I dont know whos providing your instructions, but.
<name="guard"> Follow me, Lady Stark
<name="littlefinger"> Cat! Go on Go upstairs
<name="catelyn"> You little worm! You take me for some back-alley Sally you can drag into a
<name="littlefinger"> I meant no disrespect to you of all people
<name="catelyn"> How dare you bring me here! Have you lost your mind?
<name="littlefinger"> No one will come looking for you here Isnt that what like you wanted? Im truly sorry about the locale
<name="catelyn"> How did you know I was coming to Kings Landing?
<name="littlefinger"> A dear friend told me
<name="varys"> Lady Stark
<name="catelyn"> Lord
<name="varys"> To see you again after so many years is a blessing Your poor hands
<name="catelyn"> How did you know I was coming?
<name="varys"> Knowledge is my trade, my Lady Did you bring the dagger with you, by any chance? My little birds are everywhere Even in the north They whisper to me the strangest stories Valyrian steel
<name="catelyn"> Do you know whose dagger this is?
<name="varys"> I must admit I do not
<name="littlefinger"> Well well, this is an historic day Something you dont know that I do Theres only one dagger like this in all of the Seven Kingdoms Its mine
<name="catelyn"> Yours?
<name="littlefinger"> At least it was, until the tournament on Prince Joffreys last nameday I bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting, as any sane man would When the Knight of the Flowers unseated him, I lost this dagger
<name="catelyn"> To whom?
<name="littlefinger"> Tyrion Lannister The Imp -
<name="alliser thorne"> If that were a real sword, youd be dead Lord Snow here grew up in a castle spitting down on the likes of you Pyp Do you think Ned Starks bastard bleeds like the rest of us?
<name="alliser thorne"> Next
<name="alliser thorne"> Next
<name="alliser thorne"> Lord Snow, it appears youre the least useless person here Go clean yourselves up Theres only so much I can stomach in a day
<name="tyrion"> A charming man
<name="jeor"> I dont need him to be charming I need him to turn this bunch of thieves and runaways into men of the Nights Watch
<name="tyrion"> And hows that going, Commander Mormont?
<name="jeor"> Slowly A raven came for Ned Starks son
<name="tyrion"> Good news or bad?
<name="jeor"> Both -
<name="grand maester pycelle"> Lord Stark I meant to give you this earlier So forgetful these days A raven from Winterfell this morning
<name="littlefinger"> Good news? Perhaps youd like to share it with your wife?
<name="ned"> My wife is in Winterfell
<name="littlefinger"> Is she?
<name="littlefinger"> I thought that shed be safest in here One of several such establishments I own
<name="ned"> Youre a funny man A very funny man
<name="catelyn"> Ned
<name="littlefinger"> The Starks Quick tempers, slow minds -
<name="grenn"> You broke my nose, bastard
<name="jon"> Its an improvement
<name="grenn"> If we threw you over the Wall, wonder how long itd take you to hit
<name="pyp"> I wonder if theyd find you before the wolves did
<name="grenn"> Whatre you looking at, halfman?
<name="tyrion"> Im looking at you Youve got an interesting face Very distinctive faces All of you
<name="rast"> What do you care about our faces?
<name="tyrion"> Its just I think they would look marvelous decorating spikes in Kings Landing Perhaps Ill write my sister, the Queen, about it
<name="grenn"> Well talk later, Lord Snow
<name="jon"> Everybody knew what this place was and no one told me No one but you My father knew and left me to rot here at the Wall all the same
<name="tyrion"> Grenns father left him too Outside a farmhouse when he was three Pyp was caught stealing a wheel of cheese His little sister hadnt eaten in three days He was given a choice his right hand or the Wall Ive been asking the Lord Commander about them Fascinating stories
<name="jon"> They hate me because Im better than they are
<name="tyrion"> Its a lucky thing none of them were trained by a master-at-arms like your Ser Rodrik I dont imagine any of them have ever held a real sword before they came here Your brother Bran Hes woken up -
<name="littlefinger"> The mere suggestion that the Queens brother tried to kill your boy would be considered treason
<name="catelyn"> We have proof We have the blade
<name="littlefinger"> Which Lord Tyrion will say was stolen from him The only man who could say otherwise has no throat, thanks to your boys wolf
<name="catelyn"> Petyr has promised to help us find the truth Hes like a little brother to me He would never betray my trust
<name="littlefinger"> Ill try to keep you alive, for her sake A fools task, admittedly, but Ive never been able to refuse your wife anything
<name="catelyn"> I wont forget this Youre a true friend
<name="littlefinger"> Dont tell anyone I have a reputation to maintain -
<name="cersei"> How could you be so stupid?
<name="jaime"> Calm down
<name="cersei"> Hes a child 10 years old What were you thinking?
<name="jaime"> I was thinking of us Youre a bit late to start complaining about it now What has the boy told them?
<name="cersei"> Nothing Hes said nothing He remembers nothing
<name="jaime"> Then what are you raving about?
<name="cersei"> What if it comes back to him? If he tells his father what he saw.
<name="jaime"> Well say he was lying Well say he was dreaming Well say whatever we like I think we can outfox a 10-year-old
<name="cersei"> And my husband?
<name="jaime"> Ill go to war with him if I have to They can write a ballad about us The War for Cerseis Cunt
<name="cersei"> Let me go
<name="jaime"> Never
<name="cersei"> Let me go
<name="jaime"> The boy wont talk And if he does, Ill kill him Him, Ned Stark, the King the whole bloody lot of them, until you and I are the only people left in this world -
<name="catelyn"> I wish I could see the girls
<name="ned"> Its too dangerous
<name="catelyn"> Just for a moment
<name="ned"> Until we know who our enemies are.
<name="catelyn"> I know they did it, Ned The Lannisters In my bones, I know it
<name="ned"> Littlefingers right I cant do anything without proof
<name="cersei"> And if you find the proof?
<name="ned"> Then I bring it to Robert And hope hes still the man I once knew You watch yourself on the road, huh? That temper of yours is a dangerous thing
<name="catelyn"> My temper? Gods be good, you nearly killed poor Littlefinger yesterday
<name="ned"> He still loves you
<name="catelyn"> Does he?
<name="ned"> Off with you -
<name="robert"> Its been a long time But I still remember every face You remember your first?
<name="barristan selmy"> Of course, your Grace
<name="robert"> Who was it?
<name="barristan selmy"> A Tyroshi Never learned the name
<name="robert"> Howd you do it?
<name="barristan selmy"> Lance through the heart
<name="robert"> Quick one Lucky for you Mine was some Tarly boy at the Battle of Summerhall My horse took an arrow so I was on foot, slogging through the mud He came running at me, this dumb high-born lad, thinking he could end the rebellion with the single swing of his sword I knocked him down with the hammer Gods, I was strong then Caved in his breastplate Probably shattered every rib he had Stood over him, hammer in the air Right before I brought it down he shouted, Wait! Wait! They never tell you how they all shit themselves They dont put that part in the songs Stupid boy Now the Tarlys bend the knee like everyone else He could have lingered on the edge of the battle with the smart boys and today his wife would be making him miserable, his sons would be ingrates, and hed be waking three times in the night to piss into a bowl Wine! Lancel Gods, what a stupid name Who named you? Some halfwit with a stutter? What are you doing?
<name="lancel"> Its empty, your Grace
<name="robert"> What do you mean its empty?
<name="lancel"> Theres no more wine
<name="robert"> Is that what empty means?! So get more Tell your cousin to get in here Kingslayer! Get in here Surrounded by Lannisters Every time I close my eyes I see their blond hair and their smug, satisfied faces It must wound your pride, huh? Standing out there like a glorified sentry , son of the mighty Tywin Forced to mind the door while your King eats and drinks and shits and fucks So come on Were telling war stories Who was your first kill, not counting old men?
<name="jaime"> One of the outlaws in the Brotherhood
<name="barristan selmy"> I was there that day You were only a squire, 16 years old
<name="jaime"> You killed Simon Toyne with a counter riposte Best move I ever saw
<name="barristan selmy"> A good fighter, Toyne, but he lacked stamina
<name="robert"> Your outlaw Any last words?
<name="jaime"> I cut his head off, so no
<name="robert"> What about Aerys Targaryen? What did the Mad King say when you stabbed him in the back? I never asked Did he call you a traitor? Did he plead for a reprieve?
<name="jaime"> He said the same thing hed been saying for hours Burn them all If thats all, your Grace -
<name="nan"> Do the Dothrakis buy their slaves?
<name="jorah"> The Dothraki dont believe in money Most of their slaves were given to them as gifts
<name="daenerys"> From whom?
<name="jorah"> If you rule a city and you see the horde approaching, you have two choices pay tribute or fight An easy choice for most Of course, sometimes its not enough Sometimes a Khal feels insulted by the number of slaves hes given He might think the men too weak or the women too ugly Sometimes a Khal decides his riders havent had a good fight in months and need the practice
<name="daenerys"> Tell them all to stop
<name="jorah"> You want the entire horde to stop? For how long?
<name="daenerys"> Until I command them otherwise
<name="jorah"> Youre learning to talk like a Queen
<name="daenerys"> Not a Queen A Khaleesi
<name="viserys"> You dare! You give commands to me? To me? You do not command the dragon I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms I dont take orders from savages or their sluts Do you hear me?
<name="irri"> Rakharo ask if you want him dead, Khaleesi
<name="daenerys"> No
<name="irri"> Rakharo say you should take ear, to teach respect
<name="daenerys"> Please please, dont hurt him Tell him I dont want my brother harmed
<name="viserys"> Kill these Dothraki dogs! I am your King
<name="jorah"> Shall we return to the Khalasar, Khaleesi?
<name="rakharo"> You walk -
<name="benjen"> I wanted to be here when you saw it for the first time Im leaving this morning
<name="jon"> Youre leaving?
<name="benjen"> Im the First Ranger My job is out there There have been disturbing reports
<name="jon"> What kind of reports?
<name="benjen"> The kind I dont want to believe
<name="jon"> m ready I wont let you down
<name="benjen"> Youre not going Youre no ranger, Jon
<name="jon"> But Im better than every.
<name="benjen"> Better than no one! Here A man gets what he earns, when he earns it Well speak when I return -
<name="yoren"> A bears balls
<name="tyrion"> Youre joking?
<name="yoren"> And his brains and his guts, his lungs and his heart all fried in his own fat When youre a hundred miles north of the Wall and you ate your last meal a week ago, you leave nothing for the wolves
<name="tyrion"> And how do a bears balls taste?
<name="yoren"> A bit chewy And what about you, my Lord? Whats the strangest thing youve eaten?
<name="tyrion"> Do Dornish girls count? So you roam the Seven Kingdoms, collaring pickpockets and horse thieves and bringing them here as eager recruits?
<name="yoren"> But its not all of ems done bad things Some of ems just poor lads looking for steady feed Some of ems high-born lads looking for glory
<name="tyrion"> They have a better chance finding feed than glory
<name="benjen"> The Nights Watch is a joke to you, is it? Is that what we are, Lannister? An army of jesters in black?
<name="tyrion"> You dont have enough men to be an army and aside from Yoren here, none of you are particularly funny
<name="benjen"> I hope weve provided you with some good stories to tell when youre back in Kings Landing But something to think about while youre drinking your wine down there, enjoying your brothels Half the boys youve seen training will die north of the Wall Might be a wildings axe that gets them, might be sickness, might just be the cold They die in pain And they do it so plump little lords like you can enjoy their summer afternoons in peace and comfort
<name="tyrion"> Do you think Im plump? Listen, Benjen May I call you Benjen?
<name="benjen"> Call me what you like
<name="tyrion"> Im not sure what Ive done to offend you I have great admiration for the Nights Watch Ive great admiration for you as First Ranger
<name="benjen"> You know, my brother once told me that nothing someone says before the word but really counts
<name="tyrion"> But I dont believe that giants and ghouls and White Walkers are lurking beyond the Wall I believe that the only difference between us and the wildlings is that when the Wall went up, our ancestors happened to live on the right side of it
<name="benjen"> Youre right The wildlings are no different from us A little rougher maybe But theyre made of meat and bone I know how to track them and I know how to kill them Its not the wildlings giving me sleepless nights Youve never been north of the Wall, so dont tell me whats out there
<name="yoren"> Are you going below? Keep well, keep warm
<name="benjen"> Enjoy the capital, brother
<name="yoren"> I always do
<name="tyrion"> I think hes starting to like me Going below ?
<name="yoren"> Into the tunnel and out the other side Hell be north of the Wall for a month or two
<name="tyrion"> So youre heading down to Kings Landing too
<name="yoren"> Day after tomorrow I get about half of my recruits from their dungeons
<name="tyrion"> Lets share the road I could use some decent company
<name="yoren"> I travel a bit on the grubby side, my Lord
<name="tyrion"> Not this time Well be staying at the finest castles and inns No one turns away a Lannister -
<name="irri"> Yes, Khaleesi
<name="daenerys"> What are you doing?
<name="irri"> When was last time you bleed, Khaleesi? You change, Khaleesi It’s a blessing from the Great Stallion
<name="jorah"> For a man on horseback, the curved blade is a good thing, easier to handle Its a good weapon for a Dothrakan But a man in full plate the arakh wont get through the steel Thats where the broadsword has the advantage Designed for piercing plate
<name="rakharo"> Dothraki don’t wear steel dresses
<name="jorah"> Armor
<name="rakharo"> Armor Armor make a man Vroz?
<name="jorah"> Slow
<name="rakharo"> Slow
<name="jorah"> Its true, but it also keeps a man alive
<name="rakharo"> My father taught me how to fight He taught me that speed defeats size
<name="jorah"> I’ve heard that your father was a famous warrior
<name="rakharo"> He was bloodrider to Khal Bharbo And your father, Jorah the Andal? He was a warrior also?
<name="jorah"> He still is A man of great honor And I betrayed him
<name="irri"> haleesi wants to eat something different tonight Kill some rabbits
<name="rakharo"> There are no rabbits
<name="irri"> Find some ducks, she likes ducks
<name="rakharo"> Have you seen any ducks, woman? No rabbits, no ducks Do you have eyes in your head? Do you?
<name="irri"> Dog then I have seen many dogs
<name="jorah"> I dont think she wants to eat dog
<name="irri"> haleesi have baby inside her It is true She does not bleed for two moons Her belly start to swell
<name="rakharo"> A blessing from the Great Stallion
<name="irri"> She does not want to eat horse
<name="jorah"> Ill have the boys butcher a goat for supper I need to ride to Qohor
<name="rhakaro"> We ride for Vaes Dothrak
<name="jorah"> Dont worry Ill catch you The hordes easy to find -
<name="jon"> Dont stand so still Its harder to hit a moving target Except for you You move too much I could just hold my sword out and let you do the work for me
<name="maester aemon"> How many winters have you seen, Lord Tyrion?
<name="tyrion"> Eight no, nine
<name="maester aemon"> All of them brief?
<name="tyrion"> They say the winter of my birth was three years long,
<name="maester aemon"> This summer has lasted nine But reports from the Citadel tell us the days grow shorter The Starks are always right eventually winter is coming This one will be long and dark things will come with it
<name="jeor"> Weve been capturing wildlings, more every month Theyre fleeing south The ones who flee say theyve seen the White Walkers
<name="tyrion"> Yes, and the fishermen of Lannisport say they see mermaids
<name="jeor"> One of our own rangers swore he saw them kill his companions He swore it right up to the moment Ned Stark chopped his head off
<name="maester aemon"> The Nights Watch is the only thing standing between the realm and what lies beyond And it has become an army of undisciplined boys and tired old men There are less than a thousand of us now We cant man the other castles on the Wall We cant properly patrol the wilderness Weve barely enough resources to keep our lads armed and fed
<name="jeor"> Your sister sits by the side of the King Tell her we need help
<name="maester aemon"> When winter does come, gods help us all if were not ready -
<name="daenerys"> It’s a boy
<name="khal drogo"> How do you know?
<name="daenerys"> I know -
<name="jon"> Im sorry to see you leave, Lannister
<name="tyrion"> Its either me or this cold And it doesnt appear to be going anywhere
<name="jon"> Will you stop at Winterfell on your way South?
<name="tyrion"> I expect I will Gods know there arent many feather beds between here and Kings Landing
<name="jon"> If you see my brother Bran, tell him I miss him Tell him Id visit if I could
<name="tyrion"> Of course
<name="jon"> Hell never walk again
<name="tyrion"> If youre going to be a cripple, its better to be a rich cripple Take care, Snow
<name="jon"> Farewell, My Lord -
<name="syrio forel"> You are late, boy Tomorrow you will be here at midday
<name="arya"> Who are you?
<name="syrio forel"> Your dancing master
<name="syrio forel"> Tomorrow you will catch it Now pick it up That is not the way, boy This is not a great sword that is needing two hands to swing it
<name="arya"> Its too heavy
<name="syrio forel"> It is heavy as it needs to be to make you strong Just so One hand is all that is needed Now you are standing all wrong Turn your body side-face So You are skinny That is good The target is smaller Now the grip Let me see The grip must be delicate
<name="arya"> What if I drop it?
<name="syrio forel"> The steel must be part of your arm Can you drop part of your arm? No Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of Braavos He knows these things You must listen to me, boy
<name="arya"> Im a girl
<name="syrio forel"> Boy, girl You are a sword, that is all That is the grip You are not holding a battle-axe You are holding.
<name="arya"> A needle
<name="syrio forel"> Ahhh Just so Now we will begin the dance Remember, child, this is not the dance of the Westeros we are learning The knights dance, hacking and hammering This is the Bravos dance The water dance It is swift and sudden All men are made of water, do you know this? If you pierce them, the water leaks out and they die Now you will try to strike me

<name="doreah"> Khaleesi
<name="irri"> Your hands
<name="jorah"> Were still not far from Pentos, your Grace Magister Illyrio has extended his hospitality Youd be more comfortable there
<name="viserys"> I have no interest in hospitality or comfort Ill stay with Drogo until he fulfils his end of the bargain and I have my crown
<name="jorah"> As you wish, your Grace
<name="viserys"> Well, Mormont, as brutish as this life is, I suppose it is preferable to beheading What did Ned Stark want you for? Buying from a slaver?
<name="jorah"> Selling to one Some poachers I caught on my land
<name="viserys"> Under my reign, you wont be punished for such nonsense You can rest assured of that -
<name="joffrey"> Better-looking bitches than youre used to, Uncle My mothers been looking for you We ride for Kings Landing today
<name="tyrion"> Before you go, you will call on Lord and Lady Stark and offer your sympathies
<name="joffrey"> What good will my sympathies do them?
<name="tyrion"> None But it is expected of you Your absence has already been noted
<name="joffrey"> The boy means nothing to me And I cant stand the wailing of women
<name="tyrion"> One word and Ill hit you again
<name="joffrey"> Im telling mother
<name="tyrion"> Go! Tell her But first you will get to Lord and Lady Stark and you will fall on your knees in front of them and tell them how very sorry you are, that you are at their service, and that all your prayers are with them Do you understand?
<name="joffrey"> You cant.

<name="jaime"> Little brother
<name="tyrion"> Beloved siblings
<name="myrcella"> Is Bran going to die?
<name="tyrion"> Apparently not
<name="cersei"> What do you mean?
<name="tyrion"> The Maester says the boy may live
<name="cersei"> Its no mercy, letting a child linger in such pain
<name="tyrion"> Only the gods know for certain All the rest of us can do is pray The charms of the north seem entirely lost on you
<name="cersei"> I still cant believe youre going Its ridiculous even for you
<name="tyrion"> Wheres your sense of wonder? The greatest structure ever built, the intrepid men of the Nights Watch, the wintry abode of the White Walkers
<name="jaime"> Tell me youre not thinking of taking the black
<name="tyrion"> And go celibate? The whores would go begging from Dorne to Casterly Rock I just want to stand on top of the Wall and piss off the edge of the world
<name="cersei"> The children dont need to hear your filth Come
<name="jaime"> Even if the boy lives, hell be a cripple, a grotesque Give me a good clean death any day
<name="tyrion"> Speaking for the grotesques, Id have to disagree Death is so final, whereas life Life is full of possibilities I hope the boy does wake Id be very interested to hear what he has to say
<name="jaime"> My dear brother, there are times you make me wonder whose side youre on
<name="tyrion"> My dear brother, you wound me You know how much I love my family -
<name="cersei"> Please
<name="catelyn"> I would have dressed, your Grace
<name="cersei"> This is your home Im your guest Handsome one, isnt he? I lost my first boy, a little black-haired beauty He was a fighter too Tried to beat the fever that took him Forgive me Its the last thing you need to hear right now
<name="catelyn"> I never knew
<name="cersei"> It was years ago Robert was crazed, beat his hands bloody on the wall, all the things men do to show you how much they care The boy looked just like him Such a little thing A bird without feathers They came to take his body away and Robert held me I screamed and I battled, but he held me That little bundle They took him away and I never saw him again Never have visited the crypt, never I pray to the Mother every morning and night that she return your child to you
<name="catelyn"> I am grateful
<name="cersei"> Perhaps this time shell listen -
<name="jaime"> A sword for the wall?
<name="jon"> I already have one
<name="jaime"> Good man Have you swung it yet?
<name="jon"> Of course I have
<name="jaime"> At someone, I mean Its a strange thing, the first time you cut a man You realize were nothing but sacks of meat and blood and some bone to keep it all standing Let me thank you ahead of time for guarding us all from the perils beyond the Wall Wildlings and White Walkers and whatnot Were grateful to have good, strong men like you protecting us
<name="jon"> Weve guarded the Kingdoms for 8 000 years
<name="jaime"> Is it we already? Have you taken your vows then?
<name="jon"> Soon enough
<name="jaime"> Give my regards to the Nights Watch Im sure it will be thrilling to serve in such an elite force And if not, Its only for life -
<name="arya"> Thank you, Nymeria Septa Mordane says I have to do it again My things werent properly folded , she says Who cares how theyre folded?! Theyre going to get all messed up anyway
<name="jon"> Its good youve got help

<name="jon"> I have something for you And it has to be packed very carefully
<name="arya"> A present?
<name="jon"> Close the door This is no toy Be careful you dont cut yourself
<name="arya"> Its so skinny
<name="jon"> So are you I had the blacksmith make it for you special It wont hack a mans head off, but it can poke him full of holes if youre quick enough
<name="arya"> I can be quick
<name="jon"> Youll have to work at it every day How does it feel? Do you like the balance?
<name="arya"> I think so
<name="jon"> First lesson Stick them with the pointy end
<name="arya"> I know which end to use
<name="jon"> Im going to miss you Careful All the best swords have names, you know
<name="arya"> Sansa can keep her sewing needles Ive got a needle of my own -
<name="jon"> I came to say goodbye to Bran
<name="catelyn"> Youve said it
<name="jon"> I wish I could be here when you wake up Im going north with Uncle Benjen Im taking the black I know we always talked about seeing the Wall together, but youll be able to come visit me at Castle Black when youre better Ill know my way around by then Ill be a sworn brother of the Nights Watch We can go out walking beyond the Wall, if youre not afraid
<name="catelyn"> I want you to leave
<name="catelyn"> 17 years ago you rode off with Robert Baratheon You came back a year later with another womans son And now youre leaving again
<name="ned"> I have no choice
<name="catelyn"> Thats what men always say when honor calls Thats what you tell your families, tell yourselves You do have a choice And youve made it I cant do it, Ned I really cant
<name="ned"> You can You must -
<name="robb"> Youve said goodbye to Bran? Hes not going to die I know it
<name="jon"> You Starks are hard to kill
<name="robb"> My mother?
<name="jon"> She was very kind
<name="robb"> Good Next time I see you, youll be all in black
<name="jon"> It was always my color
<name="robb"> Farewell, Snow
<name="jon"> And you, Stark -
<name="ned"> Theres great honor serving in the Nights Watch The Starks have manned the Wall for thousands of years And you are a Stark You might not have my name, but you have my blood
<name="jon"> Is my mother alive? Does she know about me? Where I am, where Im going? Does she care?
<name="ned"> The next time we see each other, well talk about your mother I promise -
<name="robert"> Gods, this is country! Ive half a mind to leave them all behind and keep going
<name="ned"> Ive half a mind to go with you
<name="robert"> What do you say, just you and me on the Kingsroad, swords at our sides, a couple of tavern wenches to warm our beds tonight
<name="ned"> You should have asked me 20 years ago
<name="robert"> There were wars to fight, women to marry We never had the chance to be young
<name="ned"> I recall a few chances
<name="robert"> There was that one Oh, what was her name? That common girl of yours? Becca? With the great big tits you could bury your face in
<name="ned"> Bessie She was one of yours
<name="robert"> Bessie! Thank the gods for Bessie and her tits Yours was Aleena? No You told me once Meryl? Your bastards mother?
<name="ned"> Wylla
<name="robert"> Thats it She must have been a rare wench to make Lord forget his honor You never told me what she looked like
<name="ned"> Nor will I
<name="robert"> We were at war None of us knew if we were gonna go back home again Youre too hard on yourself You always have been I swear if I werent your King, youd have hit me already
<name="ned"> The worst thing about your coronation Ill never get to hit you again
<name="robert"> Trust me, thats not the worst thing There was a rider in the night
<name="ned"> Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord What of it? Should we send her a wedding gift?
<name="robert"> A knife perhaps, a good sharp one, and a bold man to wield it
<name="ned"> Shes little more than a child
<name="robert"> Soon enough that child will spread her legs and start breeding
<name="ned"> Tell me were not speaking of this
<name="robert"> Oh, its unspeakable to you? What her father did to your family That was unspeakable What Rhaegar Targaryen did to your sister the woman I loved Ill kill every Targaryen I get my hands on
<name="ned"> But you cant get your hands on this one, can you?
<name="robert"> This Khal Drogo, its said he has 100,000 men in his horde
<name="ned"> Even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm, as long as they remain on the other side of the Narrow Sea They have no ships, Robert
<name="robert"> There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call me Usurper If the Targaryen boy crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back, the scum will join him
<name="ned"> He will not cross And if by chance he does, well throw him back into the sea
<name="robert"> Theres a war coming, Ned I dont know when, I dont know who well be fighting, but its coming -
<name="benjen"> Sit Youll be fed Untie them
<name="tyrion"> Rapers They were given a choice no doubt Castration or the Wall Most choose the knife Not impressed by your new brothers? Lovely thing about the Watch You discard your old family and get a whole new one
<name="jon"> Why do you read so much?
<name="tyrion"> Look at me and tell me what you see
<name="jon"> Is this a trick?
<name="tyrion"> What you see is a dwarf If Id been born a peasant they mightve left me out in the woods to die Alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock Things are expected of me My father was the Hand of the King for 20 years
<name="jon"> Until your brother killed that King
<name="tyrion"> Yes, until my brother killed him Life is full of these little ironies My sister married the new King and my repulsive nephew will be King after him I must do my part for the honor of my house, wouldnt you agree? But how? Well, my brother has his sword and I have my mind And a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone Thats why I read so much And you? Whats your story, bastard?
<name="jon"> Ask me nicely and maybe Ill tell you, dwarf
<name="tyrion"> A bastard boy with nothing to inherit, off to join the ancient order of the Nights Watch, alongside his valiant brothers-in-arms
<name="jon"> The Nights Watch protects the realm from.
<name="tyrion"> Yes yes, against grumpkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about Youre a smart boy You dont believe that nonsense Everythings better with some wine in the belly -
<name="maester luwin"> Its time we reviewed the accounts, my lady Youll want to know how much this royal visit has cost us
<name="catelyn"> Talk to Poole about it
<name="maester luwin"> Poole went south with Lord Stark, my lady We need a new steward, and there are several other appointments that require our immediate attention.
<name="catelyn"> I dont care about appointments
<name="robb"> Ill make the appointments Well talk about it first thing in the morning
<name="maester luwin"> Very good, my Lord My Lady
<name="robb"> When was the last time you left this room?
<name="catelyn"> I have to take care of him
<name="robb"> Hes not going to die, mother Maester Luwin says the most dangerous time has passed
<name="catelyn"> What if hes wrong? Bran needs me
<name="robb"> Rickon needs you Hes six He doesnt know whats happening He follows me around all day, clutching my leg, crying.
<name="catelyn"> Close the windows! I cant stand it! Please make them stop
<name="robb"> Fire You stay here Ill come back
<name="assassin"> Youre not supposed to be here No one is supposed to be here Its a mercy Hes dead already
<name="catelyn"> No! -
<name="daenerys"> Have you ever seen a dragon?
<name="irri"> Dragon gone, Khaleesi
<name="daenerys"> Everywhere? Even in the east?
<name="irri"> No dragon Brave men kill them It is known
<name="jhiqui"> It is known
<name="doreah"> A trader from Garth told me that dragons come from the moon
<name="daenerys"> The moon?
<name="doreah"> He told me the moon was an egg, Khaleesi, that once there were two moons in the sky But one wandered too close to the sun and it cracked from the heat Out of it poured a thousand thousand dragons and they drank the suns fire
<name="irri"> Moon is no egg Moon is goddess wife of sun It is known
<name="jhiqui"> It is known
<name="daenerys"> Leave me with her Why did the trader from Garth tell you these stories?
<name="doreah"> Men like to talk when theyre happy Before your brother bought me for you, it was my job to make men happy
<name="daenerys"> How old were you?
<name="doreah"> I was nine when my mother sold me to the pleasure house
<name="daenerys"> Nine?
<name="doreah"> I did not touch a man for three years, Khaleesi First you must learn
<name="daenerys"> Can you teach me how to make the Khal happy?
<name="doreah"> Yes
<name="daenerys"> Will it take three years?
<name="doreah"> No -
<name="benjen"> Welcome -
<name="catelyn"> What I am about to tell you must remain between us I dont think Bran fell from that tower I think he was thrown
<name="maester luwin"> The boy was always sure-footed before
<name="catelyn"> Someone tried to kill him twice Why? Why murder an innocent child? Unless he saw something he wasnt meant to see
<name="theon"> Saw what, my lady?
<name="catelyn"> I dont know But I would stake my life the Lannisters are involved We already have reason to suspect their loyalty to the crown
<name="rodrick cassel"> Did you notice the dagger the killer used? Its too fine a weapon for such a man The blade is Valyrian steel, the handle dragonbone Someone gave it to him
<name="robb"> They come into our home and try to murder my brother? If its war they want.
<name="theon"> If it comes to that, you know Ill stand behind you
<name="maester luwin"> What, is there going to be a battle in the Godswood? Too easily words of war become acts of war We dont know the truth yet Lord Stark must be told of this
<name="catelyn"> I dont trust a raven to carry these words
<name="robb"> Ill ride to Kings Landing
<name="catelyn"> No There must always be a Stark in Winterfell I will go myself
<name="robb"> Mother, you cant
<name="catelyn"> I must
<name="rodrick cassel"> Ill send Hal with a squad of guardsmen to escort you
<name="catelyn"> Too large a party attracts unwanted attention I dont want the Lannisters to know Im coming
<name="rodrick cassel"> Let me accompany you at least ingsroad can be a dangerous place for a woman alone
<name="robb"> What about Bran?
<name="catelyn"> I have prayed to the Seven for more than a month Brans life is in their hands now -
<name="doreah"> No, Khaleesi You must look in his eyes always Love comes in at the eyes It is said that Irogenia of Lys could finish a man with nothing but her eyes
<name="daenerys"> Finish a man?
<name="doreah"> Kings traveled across the world for a night with Irogenia Magisters sold their palaces Khals burned her enemies just to have her for a few hours They say a thousand men proposed to her and she refused them all
<name="daenerys"> Well, she sounds like an interesting woman I dont think that Drogo will like it with me on top
<name="doreah"> You will make him like it, Khaleesi Men want what theyve never had And the Dothraki take slaves like a hound takes a bitch Are you a slave, Khaleesi? Then dont make love like a slave Very good, Khaleesi Out there he is the mighty Khal, but in this tent, he belongs to you
<name="daenerys"> I dont think that this is the Dothraki way
<name="doreah"> If he wanted the Dothraki way, why did he marry you?
<name="daenerys"> No No Tonight I would look upon your face -
<name="sansa"> Pardon me, Ser
<name="sandor clegane"> Do I frighten you so much, girl? Or is it him there making you shake? He frightens me too Look at that face
<name="sansa"> Im sorry if I offended you, Ser Why wont he speak to me?
<name="sandor clegane"> He hasnt been very talkative these last 20 years Since the mad King had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers
<name="joffrey"> He speaks damn well with his sword though Ser Ilyn Payne, the Kings justice The royal executioner What is it, sweet lady? Does the hound frighten you? Away with you, dog Youre scaring my lady I dont like to see you upset The sun is finally shining Come walk with me
<name="sansa"> Stay, Lady I probably shouldnt have any more Father only lets us have one cup at feasts
<name="joffrey"> My princess can drink as much as she wants Dont worry Youre safe with me

<name="ned"> You watched my men being slaughtered and did nothing
<name="varys"> And would again, My Lord I was unarmed, unarmored and surrounded by Lannister swords When you look at me do you see a hero? What madness led you to tell the Queen you had learned the truth about Joffreys birth?
<name="ned"> The madness of mercy That she might save her children
<name="varys"> Ah, the children It is always the innocents who suffer It wasnt the wine that killed Robert, nor the boar The wine slowed him down and the boar ripped him open, but it was your mercy that killed the King I trust you know you are a dead man, Lord Eddard?
<name="ned"> The Queen cant kill me Cat holds her brother
<name="varys"> The wrong brother sadly And lost to her Your wife has let the Imp slip through her fingers

<name="lysa arryn"> Go on, sweet Time for your bath Ill feed you after
<name="catelyn"> If you fear for the safety of your son.
<name="lysa arryn"> Of course I fear for the safety of my son! Are you an idiot? They killed my husband You say they shoved your boy from a window These people will do anything
<name="catelyn"> And that is why we have to stop them
<name="lysa arryn"> The knights of the Vale will stay in the Vale where they belong, to protect their Lord beserk -
<name="tyrion"> From here it might be best if Bronn and I continue alone
<name="shagga"> Best for Tyrion son of Tywin Not best for me If the half man betrays us, Shagga son of Dolf will cut off his manhood.
<name="tyrion"> And feed it to the goats, yes All right then Time to meet my father Kevan Lannister Tyrion
<name="tyrion"> Uncle Father
<name="tywin"> The rumors of your demise were unfounded
<name="tyrion"> Sorry to disappoint you
<name="tywin"> And who are these Companions of yours?
<name="tywin"> This is Shagga Son of Dolf, Chieftain of the Stone Crows Timett Son of Timett, ruler of the Burned Men This fair maid is Chella daughter of Cheyk, leader of the Black Ears And here we have son of.
<name="bronn"> You wouldnt know him
<name="tyrion"> May I present My Lord Father, Tywin son of Tytos of House Lannister Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West Kind of you to go to war for me
<name="tywin"> You left us no choice The honor of the House was at stake Your brother would never have submitted to capture so meekly
<name="tyrion"> We have our differences, Jaime and I Hes braver Im better looking
<name="jamie"> Hes been covering himself in glory
<name="kevan"> Jaime smashed the River Lords at the Golden Tooth, and now lays siege to Riverrun, Catelyn Starks homeland
<name="tyrion"> And the Starks? Lord Eddard?
<name="tywin"> Is our hostage He will lead no armies from his dungeon cell
<name="tyrion"> How did my sweet sister persuade the King to imprison his dear friend Ned?
<name="tywin"> Robert Baratheon is dead Joffrey rules in Kings Landing
<name="tyrion"> My sister rules, you mean
<name="kevan"> Starks son has called his banners He moves south with a strong host
<name="tywin"> A green boy One taste of battle and hell run back to Winterfell wi his tail between his legs
<name="tyrion"> Maybe Though the boy does have a certain belligerence Youd like him While were on the subject of war, I made promises to my friends here and a Lannister always pays his debts We shall require 3,000 helms and shields, plus swords, pikes, gorgets, maces.
<name="messenger"> If it please My Lord, Ser Addam bids me report that the Northmen have crossed the neck
<name="tywin"> The wolf rushes into the lions jaws So be it Kevan, command the drummers beat assembly And send word to Jaime that I am moving against Robb Stark
<name="kevan"> At once, My Lord
<name="tywin"> It is said that the men of the Mountain clans are great warriors Ride with me against my enemies and you shall have all my son promised you and more
<name="shagga"> Only if the half man fights with us Until we hold the steel he pledged us, the little lions life is ours
<name="rodrik cassal"> The scouts report Lord Tywin moves north We need to get him on broken ground, put his Knights at a disadvantage
<name="greatjon umber"> No, we need to get around him and break Jaime Lannisters siege of Riverrun Do that and the River Lords will join us
<name="robb"> To do either we need to cross the river and the only crossing is at The Twins
<name="theon"> Lord Frey controls that bridge Your fathers bannerman
<name="catelyn"> The late Lord Frey my father calls him At the Trident, he didnt appear until the battle was done Some men takes their oaths more seriously than others
<name="theon"> Robbs right We need that bridge
<name="greatjon umber"> So whats it gonna be? Do we move against Jaime or Lord Tywin?
<name="guard"> Your pardon, my lords Weve captured a Lannister scout
<name="greatjon umber"> Dont worry, lad He wont be leaving this tent with his head
<name="robb"> Where did you find him?
<name="guard"> In the brush above the encampment He looked to be counting
<name="robb"> How high did you get?
<name="scout"> 20,000 Maybe more.Rodrik Cassel You dont have to do this yourself Your father would understand
<name="robb"> My father understands mercy, when there is room for it And he understands honor and courage Let him go
<name="catelyn"> Robb
<name="robb"> Tell Lord Tywin, Winter is coming for him To find out if he really does shit gold
<name="scout"> Yes, My Lord Thank you, My Lord
<name="greatjon umber"> Are you touched, boy?! Letting him go?
<name="robb"> You call me boy again
<name="robb"> Go on
<name="greatjon umber"> Oi
<name="grand maester pycelle"> It is also the wish of His Grace, that his loyal servant Janos Slynt, Commander of the City Watch.
<name="sansa"> Ser Aron
<name="grand maester pycelle"> Be at once raised to the rank of Lord
<name="sansa"> Lord Gyles
<name="grand maester pycelle"> And granted the ancient seat of Harrenhal, and that his sons and grandsons shall hold this honor after him, until the end of time In the place of the traitor Eddard Stark, it is the wish of his Grace that Tywin Lannister, Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West, be appointed Hand of the King Lastly, in these times of treason and turmoil, it is the view of the Council that the life and safety of King Joffrey be of paramount importance
<name="cersei"> Se
<name="barristan selmy"> Your Grace, I am yours to command
<name="cersei"> Rise, Ser Barristan You may remove your helm You have served the Realm long and faithfully Every man and woman in the Seven Kingdoms owes you thanks But it is time to put aside your armor and your sword It is time to rest and look back with pride on your many years of service
<name="barristan selmy"> Your Grace, the Kingsguard is a sworn brotherhood Our vows are taken for life Only death relieves us of our sacred trust
<name="cersei"> Whose death, Ser Barristan? Yours or your Kings?
<name="king joffrey"> You let my father die Youre too old to protect anybody
<name="barristan selmy"> Your Grace.
<name="cersei"> The Council has determined that Ser Jaime Lannister will take your place as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard
<name="barristan selmy"> The man who profaned his blade with the blood of the King he had sworn to defend
<name="cersei"> Careful, Ser
<name="varys"> We have nothing but gratitude for your long service, good Ser You shall be given a stout Keep beside the sea, with servants to look after your every need
<name="barristan selmy"> A hall to die in and men to bury me I am a Knight I shall die a Knight
<name="littlefinger"> A naked Knight, apparently
<name="barristan selmy"> Even now I could cut through the five of you like carving a cake! Here, boy! Melt it down and add it to the others
<name="kings landing page"> If any man in this hall has other matters to set before His Grace, let him speak now or go forth and hold his silence
<name="sansa"> Your Grace
<name="king joffrey"> Come forward, My Lady
<name="kings landing page"> The Lady Sansa of House Stark
<name="cersei"> Do you have some business for the King and the Council, Sansa?
<name="sansa"> I do
<name="sansa"> As it please Your Grace, I ask mercy for my father, Lord Eddard Stark, who was Hand of the King
<name="grand maester pycelle"> Treason is a noxious weed It should be torn out, root.
<name="king joffrey"> Let her speak I want to hear what she says
<name="sansa"> Thank you, Your Grace
<name="littlefinger"> Do you deny your fathers crime?
<name="sansa"> No, My Lords I know he must be punished All I ask is mercy I know My Lord father must regret what he did He was King Roberts friend and he loved him You all know he loved him He never wanted to be Hand until the King asked him They must have lied to him Lord Renly or Lord Stannis or somebody They must have lied
<name="king joffrey"> He said I wasnt the King Why did he say that?
<name="sansa"> He was badly hurt Maester Pycelle was giving him milk of the poppy He wasnt himself Otherwise h never would have said it
<name="varys"> A childs faith Such sweet innocence And yet they say wisdom oft comes from the mouths of babes
<name="grand maester pycelle"> Treason is treason
<name="king joffrey"> Anything else?
<name="sansa"> If you still have any affection in your heart for me, please do me this kindness, Your Grace
<name="king joffrey"> Your sweet words have moved me But your father has to confess He has to confess and say that Im the King or therell be no mercy for him

<name="maester luwin"> Your mother had to leave Winterfell to protect the family
<name="bran"> How can she protect the family, if shes not with her family?
<name="maester luwin"> Your mother sat by your bed for three weeks while you slept
<name="bran"> And then she left
<name="maester luwin"> When you were born, I was the one who pulled you from your mother I placed you in her arms From that moment until the moment she dies, she will love you Absolutely Fiercely

<name="bran"> Then how can you promise me shell be home soon?
<name="maester luwin"> Sometimes I worry youre too smart for your own good
<name="bran"> Ill never shoot another arrow
<name="maester luwin"> And where is that written?
<name="bran"> You need legs to work a bow
<name="maester luwin"> Hmm If the saddle Lord Tyrion designed actually works, you could learn to shoot a bow from horseback
<name="bran"> Really?
<name="maester luwin"> Dothraki boys learn when theyre four years old Why shouldnt you? -
<name="theon"> Shh Keep it down Youre not supposed to be inside the castle walls
<name="ros"> I thought you were supposed to be an important person around here
<name="theon"> Important enough for the likes of you
<name="ros"> Youre not the only nobleman in my life, you know
<name="theon"> Who? the Imp? Id call him half a nobleman
<name="ros"> Jealous?
<name="theon"> Why should I be jealous?
<name="theon"> Anyone with a few coppers in his pocket can own you for the night Whats a dwarf like down below? Ive always wondered
<name="ros"> Might surprise you
<name="theon"> Hmm?
<name="ros"> Hes good with his fingers too And his tongue
<name="theon"> Generous tipper I guess gold is cheap for a Lannister
<name="ros"> You are jealous
<name="theon"> Im a Greyjoy Weve been Lords of the Iron Islands for 300 years Theres not a family in Westeros that can look down on us, not even the Lannisters
<name="ros"> And what about the Starks?
<name="theon"> I’ve been Lord Stark’s ward since I was eight years old
<name="ros"> A ward”, that’s a nice word for it Your father rebelled against King Robert and if he does it again
<name="theon"> My father fought for the freedom of his people! What did your father do? Fucked a cook and whelped a whore
<name="ros"> You’re a very serious boy
<name="theon"> I’m not a boy
<name="ros"> Oh, yes you are A serious boy, with a serious cock
<name="theon"> I don’t want to pay for it
<name="ros"> Then get yourself a wife -
<name="arya"> Come on Im not gonna hurt you
<name="varys"> How is your son, my Lord?
<name="ned"> Hell never walk again
<name="varys"> But his mind is sound?
<name="ned"> So they say
<name="varys"> A blessing then I suffered an early mutilation myself Some doors close forever others open in the most unexpected places May I?
<name="varys"> If the wrong ears heard what Im about to tell you, off comes my head And who would mourn poor Varys then? North or South, they sing no songs for spiders But there are things you must know You are the Kings Hand and the King is a fool your friend, I know, but a fool and doomed unless you save him
<name="ned"> Ive been in the capital a month Why have you waited so long to tell me this?
<name="varys"> I didnt trust you
<name="ned"> So why do you trust me now?
<name="varys"> The Queen is not the only one who has been watching you closely There are few men of honor in the capital You are one of them I would like to believe I am another, strange as that may seem
<name="ned"> What sort of doom does the King face?
<name="varys"> The same sort as Jon Arryn The tears of Lys, they call it A rare and costly thing, as clear and tasteless as water It leaves no trace
<name="ned"> Who gave it to him?
<name="varys"> Some dear friend, no doubt But which one? There were many Lord Arryn was a kind and trusting man There was one boy all he was he owed to Jon Arryn
<name="ned"> The squire, Ser Hugh?
<name="varys"> Pity what happened to him, just when his life seemed to be going so nicely
<name="ned"> If Ser Hugh poisoned him, who paid Ser Hugh?
<name="varys"> Someone who could afford it
<name="ned"> Jon was a man of peace He was Hand for 17 years 17 good years Why kill him?
<name="varys"> He started asking questions -
<name="varys"> Hes found one bastard already He has the book The rest will come
<name="illyrio mopatis"> And when he knows the truth, what will he do?
<name="varys"> The gods alone know The fools tried to kill his son Whats worse, they botched it The wolf and the lion will be at each others throats We will be at war soon, my friend
<name="illyrio mopatis"> What good is war now? Were not ready If one Hand can die, why not a second?
<name="varys"> This Hand is not the other
<name="illyrio mopatis"> We need time Khal Drogo will not make his move until his son is born You know how these savages are
<name="varys"> Delay, you say Move fast, I reply This is no longer a game for two players
<name="illyrio mopatis"> It never was -
<name="varys"> The first to arrive and the last to leave I admire your industry
<name="littlefinger"> You do move quietly
<name="varys"> We all have our qualities
<name="littlefinger"> You look a bit lonely today You should pay a visit to my brothel this evening First boy is on the house
<name="varys"> I think youre mistaking business with pleasure
<name="littlefinger"> Am I? All those birds that whisper in your ear, such pretty little things Trust me, we accommodate all inclinations
<name="varys"> Oh, Im sure Lord Redwyne likes his boys very young, I hear
<name="littlefinger"> Im a purveyor of beauty and discretion, both equally important
<name="varys"> Though I suppose beauty is a subjective quality, no? Is it true that Ser Marlon of Tumblestone prefers amputees?
<name="littlefinger"> All desires are valid to a man with a full purse
<name="varys"> And I heard the most awful rumor about a certain lord with a taste for fresh cadavers Must be enormously difficult to accommodate that inclination The logistics alone to find beautiful corpses before they rot
<name="littlefinger"> Strictly speaking, such a thing would not be in accordance with the Kings laws
<name="varys"> Strictly speaking
<name="littlefinger"> Tell me Does someone, somewhere, keep your balls in a little box? Ive often wondered
<name="varys"> Do you know, I have no idea where they are? And we had been so close But enough about me How have you been since we last saw each other?
<name="littlefinger"> Since you last saw me or since I last saw you?
<name="varys"> Now the last time I saw you, you were talking to the Hand of the King
<name="littlefinger"> Saw me with your own eyes?
<name="varys"> Eyes I own
<name="littlefinger"> Council business We all have so much to discuss with Ned Stark
<name="varys"> Everyones well aware of your enduring fondness for Lord Starks wife If the Lannisters were behind the attempt on the Stark boys life and it was discovered that you helped the Starks come to that conclusion To think A simple word to the Queen.
<name="littlefinger"> One shudders at the thought
<name="varys"> Oh
<name="littlefinger"> But you know something? I do believe that I have seen you even more recently than you have seen me
<name="varys"> Have you?
<name="littlefinger"> Yes Earlier today, I distinctly recall seeing you talking to Lord Stark in his chambers
<name="varys"> Was that you under the bed?
<name="littlefinger"> And not long after that when I saw you escorting a certain foreign dignitary Council business? Of course you would have friends from across The Narrow Sea Youre from there yourself, after all Were friends, arent we, Lord ? Id like to think we are So you can imagine my burden, wondering if the King might question my friends sympathies To stand at a crossroads where turning left means loyalty to a friend, turning right, loyalty to the realm
<name="varys"> Oh, please
<name="littlefinger"> To find myself in a position where a simple word to the King -
<name="renly"> What are you two conspiring about? Well, whatever it is, youd best hurry up My brother is coming
<name="littlefinger"> To a small council meeting?
<name="varys"> Disturbing news from far away Havent you heard? -
<name="guard"> Off with you No begging
<name="arya"> Im not a beggar I live here
<name="guard"> Dyou want a smack on your ear to help you with your hearing?
<name="arya"> I want to see my father
<name="guard"> I want to fuck the Queen, for all the good it does me
<name="guard"> You want your father, boy? Hes lying on the floor of some tavern, getting pissed on by his friends
<name="arya"> My father is Hand of the King! Im not a boy Im Arya Stark of Winterfell and if you lay a hand on me, my father will have both your heads on spikes! Now are you going to let me by or do I need to smack you on the ear to help with your hearing?
<name="ned"> You know I had half my guard out searching for you? You promised me this would stop
<name="arya"> They said they were going to kill you
<name="ned"> Who did?
<name="arya"> I didnt see them, but I think one was fat
<name="ned"> Oh, Arya
<name="arya"> Im not lying! They said you found the bastard and the wolves are fighting the lions and the savage something about the savage
<name="ned"> Where did you hear this?
<name="arya"> In the dungeons, near the dragon skulls
<name="ned"> What were you doing in the dungeons?
<name="arya"> Chasing a cat
<name="jory cassel"> Pardon, my Lord Theres a Nights Watchman here begging a word He says its urgent
<name="ned"> Your name, friend?
<name="yoren"> Yoren, if it please This must be your son He has the look
<name="arya"> Im a girl
<name="ned"> Did Benjen send you?
<name="yoren"> No one sent me, my Lord Im here to find men for The Wall, see if theres any scum in the dungeons that might be fit for service
<name="ned"> Ah, well find recruits for you
<name="yoren"> Thank you, my Lord But thats not why I disturb you now Your brother, Benjen his blood runs black, makes him as much my brother as yours Its for his sake I rode here so hard I damn near killed my horse! There are others riding too The whole city will know by tomorrow
<name="ned"> Know what?
<name="yoren"> Best said in private, my Lord
<name="ned"> Go on Well talk more later
<name="ned"> Jory, take her safely to her room
<name="jory cassel"> Come along, my Lady You heard your father
<name="arya"> How many guards does my father have?
<name="jory cassel"> Here in Kings Landing? Fifty
<name="arya"> You wouldnt let anyone kill him, would you?
<name="jory cassel"> No fear on that count, little Lady
<name="ned"> Well?
<name="yoren"> Its about your wife, my Lord Shes taken the Imp -
<name="vardis egen"> Youre far from home, Lady Stark
<name="catelyn"> To whom do I speak?
<name="vardis egen"> Ser Vardis Egen, Knight of The Vale Is Lady Arryn expecting your visit?
<name="catelyn"> There was no time to send word
<name="vardis egen"> May I ask, my Lady, why he is with you?
<name="catelyn"> Thats why there was no time He is my prisoner
<name="vardis egen"> He doesnt look like a prisoner
<name="catelyn"> My sister will decide what he looks like
<name="vardis egen"> Yes, my Lady She will at that
<name="tyrion"> The Eyrie They say its impregnable
<name="bronn"> Give me 10 good men and some climbing spikes Ill impregnate the bitch
<name="tyrion"> I like you -
<name="steward"> Lord Stark, your presence has been requested in the small council chamber A meeting has been called
<name="ned"> I need to see the King first alone
<name="steward"> ing is at the small council meeting, my Lord He has summoned you
<name="ned"> Is it about my wife?
<name="steward"> No, my Lord I believe it concerns Daenerys Targaryen
<name="robert"> The whore is pregnant
<name="ned"> Youre speaking of murdering a child
<name="robert"> I warned you this would happen Back in the North, I warned you, but you didnt care to hear Well, hear it now I want em dead, mother and child both And that fool, Viserys as well Is that plain enough for you? I want them both dead
<name="ned"> You will dishonor yourself forever if you do this
<name="robert"> Honor?! Ive got Seven Kingdoms to rule! One King, Seven Kingdoms Do you think honor keeps them in line? Do you think its honor thats keeping the peace? Its fear! Fear and blood
<name="ned"> Then were no better than the Mad King
<name="robert"> Careful, Ned Careful now
<name="ned"> You want to assassinate a girl Because the Spider heard a rumor?
<name="varys"> No rumor, my Lord The princess is with child
<name="ned"> Based on whose information?
<name="varys"> Ser Jorah Mormont He is serving as adviser to the Targaryens
<name="ned"> Mormont? You bring us the whispers of a traitor half a world away and call it fact?
<name="littlefinger"> Jorah Mormonts a slaver, not a traitor Small difference, I know, to an honorable man
<name="ned"> He broke the law, betrayed his family, fled our land We commit murder on the word of this man?
<name="robert"> And if hes right? If she has a son? A Targaryen at the head of a Dothraki army What then?
<name="ned"> The Narrow Sea still lies between us Ill fear the Dothraki the day they teach their horses to run on water
<name="robert"> Do nothing? Thats your wise advice? Do nothing til our enemies are on our shores? Youre my council? Counsel! Speak sense to this honorable fool
<name="varys"> I understand your misgivings, my Lord Truly, I do It is a terrible thing we must consider, a vile thing Yet, we who presume to rule must sometimes do vile things for the good of the realm Should the gods grant Daenerys a son, the realm will bleed
<name="grand maester pycelle"> I bear this girl no ill will, but should the Dothraki invade, how many innocents will die? How many towns will burn? Is it not wiser, kinder even, that she should die now so that tens of thousands might live?
<name="renly"> We should have had them both killed years ago
<name="littlefinger"> When you find yourself in bed with an ugly woman, best close your eyes, get it over with Cut her throat Be done with it
<name="ned"> I followed you into war twice, without doubts, without second thoughts But I will not follow you now The Robert I grew up with didnt tremble at the shadow of an unborn child
<name="robert"> She dies
<name="ned"> I will have no part in it
<name="robert"> Youre the Kings Hand, Lord Stark Youll do as I command or Ill find me a Hand who will
<name="ned"> And good luck to him I thought you were a better man
<name="robert"> Out! Out, damn you! Im done with you Go! Run back to Winterfell! Ill have your head on a spike! Ill put it there myself, you fool! You think youre too good for this? Too proud and honorable? This is a war! -
<name="ned"> Ill go ahead with my daughters Get them ready Do it yourself Dont ask anyone for help
<name="jory cassel"> Right away, my Lord Lord Baelish is here for you
<name="littlefinger"> His Grace went on about you at some length after you took your leave The word treason was mentioned
<name="ned"> What can I do for you?
<name="littlefinger"> When do you return to Winterfell?
<name="ned"> Why? What do you care?
<name="littlefinger"> If youre still here come nightfall, Ill take you to see the last person Jon Arryn spoke with before falling ill If that sort of thing still interests you
<name="ned"> I dont have the time
<name="littlefinger"> It wont take more than an hour But as you please
<name="ned"> Round up all the men we have and station them outside the girls chambers Who are your best two swords?
<name="jory cassel"> Heward and Wyl
<name="ned"> Find them and meet me at the stables -
<name="lysa arryn"> You bring him here without permission? You pollute my home with his presence? Your aunt has done a bad thing, Robin, a very bad thing You remember her, dont you? Isnt he beautiful? And strong too Jon knew it His last words were, the seed is strong He wanted everyone to know what a good, strong boy his son would grow up to be Look at him, the Lord of all the Vale
<name="catelyn"> Lysa, you wrote me about the Lannisters, warning me t
<name="lysa arryn"> To stay away from them! Not to bring one here
<name="robin arryn"> Mommy? Is that the bad man?
<name="lysa arryn"> It is
<name="robin arryn"> Hes little
<name="lysa arryn"> Hes Tyrion the Imp of House Lannister He killed your father He murdered the Hand of the King
<name="tyrion"> Oh? Did I kill him too? Ive been a very busy man
<name="lysa arryn"> You will watch your tongue! These men are Knights of the Vale Every one of the loved Jon Arryn Every one of them would die for me
<name="tyrion"> If any harm comes to me, my brother, Jaime, will see that they do
<name="robin arryn"> You cant hurt us! No one can hurt us here! Tell him, mommy! Tell him
<name="lysa arryn"> Shh Shh Shh, my sweet boy Hes just trying to frighten us Lannisters are all liars No one will hurt my baby
<name="robin arryn"> Mommy I want to see the bad man fly
<name="lysa arryn"> Perhaps you will, my little love
<name="catelyn"> This man is my prisoner I will not have him harmed
<name="lysa arryn"> Ser Vardis, my sisters guest is weary Take him down below so he can rest Introduce him t
<name="mord"> You go sleep, dwarf man Sleep good, little dwarf man! -
<name="loras"> Lord Starks lucky he still has a head
<name="renly"> Robert will rant for a few days, but he wont do anything He adores the man
<name="loras"> Youre jealous
<name="renly"> Are you sure this wont hurt?
<name="loras"> Only if I slip
<name="renly"> And you prefer me like this?
<name="loras"> Mhmm
<name="renly"> If you want hairless, maybe you should find a little boy
<name="loras"> I want you
<name="renly"> My brother thinks that anyone who hasnt been to war isnt a man He treats me as if Im a spoiled child Oh, and youre not? , the Knight of the Flowers? How many wars have you fought in? Oh, and how much did your father spend on that armor of yours?
<name="loras"> Hold still
<name="renly"> All I ever hear from Robert and Stannis is how Im not tough enough, how I squirm at the sight of blood
<name="loras"> You did vomit when that boys eye was knocked out in the mêlée
<name="renly"> His eye was dangling out of the damn socket
<name="loras"> He shouldnt have entered the mêlée if he didnt know how to fight
<name="renly"> Easy for you to say Not everyone is such a gifted swordsman
<name="loras"> Its not a gift No one gave it to me Im good because I work at it every day of my life since I could hold a stick
<name="renly"> I could work at fighting all day, every day, and still never be as good as you
<name="loras"> Yes well, I guess well never know
<name="renly"> Everywhere?
<name="loras"> Everywhere So how did it end up? The Targaryen girl will die?
<name="renly"> It needs to be done, unpleasant as it is Roberts rather tasteless about it Every time he talks about killing her, I swear the table rises six inches
<name="loras"> Its a shame he cant muster the same enthusiasm for his wife
<name="renly"> He does have a deep, abiding lust for her money You have to give it to the Lannisters, they may be the most pompous, ponderous cunts the gods ever suffered to walk the world, but they do have outrageous amounts of money
<name="loras"> I have an outrageous amount of money
<name="renly"> Not as much as the Lannisters
<name="loras"> But a lot more than you
<name="renly"> Roberts threatening to take me hunting with him Last time we were out there for two weeks, tramping through the trees in the rain, day after day All so he can stick his spear into somethings flesh! Oh but Robert loves his killing And hes the King
<name="loras"> Hmm How did that ever happen?
<name="renly"> Because he loves his killing and he used to be good at it
<name="loras"> Do you know who should be King?
<name="renly"> Be serious
<name="loras"> I am My father could be your bank Ive never fought in a war before, but Id fight for you
<name="renly"> Im fourth in line
<name="loras"> And where was Robert in the line of royal succession? Joffrey is a monster Tommen is eight
<name="renly"> Stannis?
<name="loras"> Stannis has the personality of a lobster
<name="renly"> Hes still my older brother
<name="renly"> What are you doing?
<name="loras"> Look at it
<name="renly"> You cut me
<name="loras"> Its just blood Weve all got it in us Sometimes a little spills If you become King, youre going to see a lot of this You need to get used to it Go on Look People love you They love to serve you because youre kind to them They want to be near you
<name="loras"> Youre willing to do what needs to be done, but you dont gloat over it You dont love killing Where is it written that power is the sole province of the worst? That thrones are only made for the hated and the feared You would be a wonderful King -
<name="cersei"> Im sorry your marriage to Ned Stark didnt work out You seemed so good together
<name="robert"> Im glad I could do something to make you happy
<name="cersei"> Without a Hand, everything will fall to pieces
<name="robert"> I suppose this is where you tell me to give the job to your brother Jaime
<name="cersei"> No Hes not serious enough Ill say this for Ned Stark hes serious enough Was it really worth it? Losing him this way?
<name="robert"> I dont know But I do know this, if the Targaryen girl convinces her horse-lord husband to invade and the Dothraki horde crosses The Narrow Sea We wont be able to stop them
<name="cersei"> The Dothraki dont sail Every child knows that They dont have discipline They dont have armor They dont have siege weapons
<name="robert"> Its a neat little trick you do, you move your lips and your fathers voice comes out
<name="cersei"> Is my father wrong?
<name="robert"> Lets say Viserys Targaryen lands with forty thousand Dothraki screamers at his back We hole up in our castles, a wise move Only a fool would meet the Dothraki in an open field They leave us in our castles They go from town to town, looting and burning, killing every man who cant hide behind a stone wall, stealing all our crops and livestock, enslaving all our women and children How long do the people of the Seven Kingdoms stand behind their absentee King, their cowardly King hiding behind high walls? When do the people decide that Viserys Targaryen is the rightful monarch after all
<name="cersei"> We still outnumber them
<name="robert"> Which is the bigger number five or one?
<name="cersei"> Five
<name="robert"> Five one One army, a real army, united behind one leader with one purpose Our purpose died with the Mad King Now weve got as many armies as there are men with gold in their purse And everybody wants something different Your father wants to own the world Ned Stark wants to run away and bury his head in the snow
<name="cersei"> What do you want?
<name="robert"> We havent had a real fight in nine years Back-stabbing doesnt prepare you for a fight And thats all the realm is now, back-stabbing and scheming and arse-licking and money-grubbing Sometimes I dont know what holds it together
<name="cersei"> Our marriage
<name="robert"> Ah, so here we sit, seventeen years later, holding it all together Dont you get tired?
<name="cersei"> Every day
<name="robert"> How long can hate hold a thing together?
<name="cersei"> Well, seventeen years is quite a long time
<name="robert"> Yes, it is
<name="cersei"> Yes, it tis What was she like?
<name="robert"> Youve never asked about her, not once Why not?
<name="cersei"> At first, just saying her name, even in private felt like I was breathing life back into her I thought if I didnt talk about her, shed just fade away for you When I realized that wasnt going to happen, I refused to ask out of spite I didnt want to give you the satisfaction of thinking I cared enough to ask And eventually it became clear that my spite didnt mean anything to you, as far as I could tell, you actually enjoyed it
<name="robert"> So why now?
<name="cersei"> What harm could Lyanna Starks ghost do to either of us that we havent done to each other a hundred times over?
<name="robert"> You want to know the horrible truth? I cant even remember what she looked like I only know she was the one thing I ever wanted Someone took her away from me, and Seven Kingdoms couldnt fill the hole she left behind
<name="cersei"> I felt something for you once, you know?
<name="robert"> I know
<name="cersei"> Even after we lost our first boy for quite a while, actually Was it ever possible for us? Was there ever a time, ever a moment?
<name="robert"> No Does that make you feel better or worse?
<name="cersei"> It doesnt make me feel anything -
<name="mhaegen"> She looks like him, dont she, my Lord? She has his nose, his black hair
<name="ned"> Aye
<name="mhaegen"> Tell him when you see him, my Lord If it please you Tell him how beautiful she is
<name="ned"> I will
<name="mhaegen"> And tell him Ive been with no one else I swear it, my Lord, by the old gods and new I dont want no jewels or nothing, just him ing was always good to me
<name="ned"> When Jon Arryn came to visit you, what did he want?
<name="mhaegen"> He wasnt that sort of man, my Lord He just wanted to know if the child was happy, healthy
<name="ned"> She looks healthy enough to me The girl shall want for nothing
<name="littlefinger"> Brothels make a much better investment than ship, Ive found Whores rarely sink
<name="ned"> What do you know of King Roberts bastards?
<name="littlefinger"> Well, he has more than you, for a start
<name="ned"> How many?
<name="littlefinger"> Does it matter? If you fuck enough women, some of them will give you presents
<name="ned"> And Jon Arryn tracked them all down Why?
<name="littlefinger"> He was the Kings Hand Perhaps Robert wanted them looked after He was overcome with fatherly love
<name="ned"> Come
<name="ned"> Jory
<name="jory cassel"> My Lord
<name="jaime"> Such a small pack of wolves
<name="jory cassel"> Stay back, Ser! This is the Hand of the King
<name="jaime"> Was! the Hand of the King Now Im not sure what he is Lord of somewhere very far away
<name="littlefinger"> Whats the meaning of this, Lannister?
<name="jaime"> Get back inside where its safe Im looking for my brother You remember my brother, dont you, Lord Stark? Blond hair, sharp tongue, short man
<name="ned"> I remember him well
<name="jaime"> It seems he had some trouble on the road You wouldnt know what happened to him, would you?
<name="ned"> He was taken at my command to answer for his crimes
<name="littlefinger"> My Lords! Ill bring the City Watch
<name="jaime"> Come, Stark Id rather you die sword in hand
<name="jory cassel"> If you threaten my Lord again.
<name="jaime"> Threaten? As in, Im going to open your Lord from balls to brains and see what Starks are made of”?
<name="ned"> You kill me, your brothers a dead man
<name="jaime"> Youre right Take him alive! Kill his men

<name="bran"> Jon said he was a deserter
<name="ned"> But do you understand why I had to kill him?
<name="bran"> Our way is the old way?
<name="ned"> The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword

<name="jaime"> As your brother, I feel it’s my duty to warn you You worry too much It’s starting to show
<name="cersei"> And you never worry about anything When we were seven, you jumped off the cliffs as Casterly Rock One hundred foot drop into the water And you were never afraid
<name="jaime"> There was nothing to be afraid of until you told father We’re Lannisters Lannisters don’t act like fools
<name="cersei"> What if Jon Arryn told someone?
<name="jaime"> But who would he tell?
<name="cersei"> My husband
<name="jaime"> If he told the king, both our heads would be skewered on the city gates by now Whatever Jon Arryn knew or didn’t know, it died with him And Robert will choose a new Hand of the king, someone to do his job while he’s off fucking boars and hunting whores Or is it the other way around? And life will go on
<name="cersei"> You should be the Hand of the king
<name="jaime"> That’s an honor I can do without Their days are too long, their lives are too short
<name="catelyn"> All these years and I still feel like an outsider when I come here

<name="catelyn"> We need plenty of candles for Lord Tyrion’s chamber I’m told he reads all night
<name="maester luwin"> I’m told he drinks all night
<name="catelyn"> How much could he possibly drink? A man of his stature
<name="luwin"> We’ve brought up eight barrels of ale from the cellar Perhaps we’ll find out
<name="catelyn"> In any case, candles
<name="jon"> Why’s your mother so dead-set on us getting pretty for the king?
<name="theon"> It’s for the queen, I bet I hear she
<name="robb"> I hear the prince is a right royal prick
<name="theon"> Think of all those southern girls he gets to stab with his right royal prick
<name="robb"> Go on, Tommy, shave him good He’s never met a girl he likes better than his own hair
<name="catelyn"> Gods, but they grow fast Brandon
<name="bran"> I saw the king! He’s got hundreds of people

<name="ros"> And the queen And her twin brother They say that he is the most handsome man in the Seven Kingdoms
<name="tyrion"> And the other brother?
<name="ros"> The queen has two brothers?

<name="ros"> I hear they call him the Imp
<name="tyrion"> I hear he hates that nickname
<name="ros"> Oh? I hear he’s more than earned it I hear he’s a drunken little lecher into all manner of perversions
<name="tyrion"> Clever girl
<name="ros"> We’ve been expecting you, Lord Tyrion
<name="tyrion"> Have you?
<name="tyrion"> The gods gave me one blessing
<name="jaime"> Don’t get up
<name="ros"> M’lord
<name="tyrion"> Should I explain to you the meaning of a closed door in a whorehouse, brother?
<name="jaime"> You’ve much to teach me, no doubt But our sister craves your attention
<name="tyrion"> She has odd cravings, our sister
<name="jaime"> A family trait Now, the Starks are feasting us at sundown Don’t leave me alone with these people
<name="tyrion"> I’m sorry, I’ve begun the feast a bit early And this is the first of many courses
<name="jaime"> I thought you might say that But since we’re short on time, Come on, girls See you at sundown
<name="tyrion"> Close the door!Scene changes to the Winterfell crypt, at Lyanna’s tomb
<name="robert"> Did you have to bury her in a place like this? She should be on a hill somewhere with the sun and the clouds above her
<name="ned"> She was my sister This is where she belongs
<name="robert"> She belonged with me
<name="robert"> In my dreams, I kill him every night
<name="ned"> It’s done, Your Grace The Targaryens are gone
<name="robert"> Not all of them
<name="viserys"> Daenerys
<name="viserys"> Daenerys! There’s our bride to be! Look – a gift from Illyrio Touch it Come on Feel the fabric Mmmm Isn’t he a gracious host?
<name="daenerys"> We’ve been his guests for over a year and he’s never asked us for anything
<name="viserys"> Illyrio is no fool He knows I won’t forget my friends when I come into my throne You still slouch Let me see You have a woman’s body now I need you to be perfect today Can you do that for me? You don’t want to wake the dragon, do you?
<name="daenerys"> No
<name="viserys"> When they write the history of my reign, sweet sister, they will say it began today
<name="maid"> It’s too hot, my lady
<name="viserys"> Where is he?
<name="illyrio"> The Dothraki are not known for their punctuality
<name="illyrio"> May I present my honored guests? Viserys of House Targaryen, the third of his name The rightful King of the Andals and the First Men And his sister, Daenerys, of the House Targaryen
<name="viserys"> Do you see how long his hair is? When Dothraki are defeated in combat, they cut off their braid so the whole world can see their shame Khal Drogo has never been defeated He’s a savage, of course, but he’s one of the finest killers alive And you will be his queen
<name="illyrio"> Come forward, my dear
<name="viserys"> Where’s he going?
<name="illyrio"> The ceremony is over
<name="viserys"> But he didn’t say anything Did he like her?
<name="illyrio"> Trust me, Your Grace If he didn’t like her, we’d know
<name="illyrio"> It won’t be long now Soon you will cross the Narrow Sea and take back your father’s throne The people drink secret toasts to your health They cry out for their true king
<name="viserys"> When will they be married?
<name="illyrio"> Soon The Dothraki never stay still for long
<name="viserys"> Is it true they lie with their horses?
<name="illyrio"> I wouldn’t ask Khal Drogo
<name="viserys"> Do you take me for a fool?
<name="illyrio"> I take you for a king Kings lack the caution of common men My apologies if I’ve given offense
<name="viserys"> I know how to play a man like Drogo I give him a queen and he gives me an army DAENERYS I don’t want to be his queen I want to go home
<name="viserys"> So do I I want us both to go home But they took it from us So tell me, sweet sister, how do we go home?
<name="daenerys"> I don’t know
<name="viserys"> We go home with an army With Khal Drogo’s army I would let his whole tribe fuck you, all 40,000 men and their horses too, if that’s what it took
<name="sansa"> Do you think Joffrey will like me? What if he thinks I’m ugly?
<name="catelyn"> Then he is the stupidest prince that ever lived
<name="sansa"> He’s so handsome
<name="sansa"> When would we be married? Soon or do we have to wait?
<name="catelyn"> Hush now Your father hasn’t even said yes
<name="sansa"> Why would he say no? He’d be the second most powerful man in the kingdoms
<name="catelyn"> He’d have to leave home He’d have to leave me And so would you
<name="sansa"> You left your home to come here And I’d be queen someday Please make father say yes
<name="catelyn"> Sansa
<name="sansa"> Please, please It’s the only thing I ever wanted
<name="benjen"> Is he dead yet?
<name="jon"> Uncle Benjen
<name="benjen"> You got bigger I rode all day Didn’t want to leave you alone with the Lannisters Why aren’t you at the feast?
<name="jon"> Lady Stark thought it might insult the royal family to seat a bastard in their midst
<name="benjen"> Well, you’re always welcome on the wall No bastard was ever refused a seat there
<name="jon"> So take me with you when you go back
<name="benjen"> Jon
<name="jon"> Father will let me if you ask him, I know he will
<name="benjen"> The Wall isn’t going anywhere
<name="jon"> I’m ready to swear your oath
<name="benjen"> You don’t understand what you’d be giving up We have no families None of us will ever father sons
<name="jon"> I don’t care about that
<name="benjen"> You might, if you knew what it meant I’d better get inside Rescue your father from his guests We’ll talk later
<name="tyrion"> Your uncle’s in the Night’s Watch
<name="jon"> What’re you doing back there?
<name="tyrion"> Preparing for a night with your family I’ve always wanted to see the Wall
<name="jon"> You’re Tyrion Lannister The queen’s brother?
<name="tyrion"> My greatest accomplishment You – you’re Ned Stark’s bastard, aren’t you?
<name="tyrion"> Did I offend you? Sorry You are the bastard, though
<name="jon"> Lord Eddard Stark is my father
<name="tyrion"> And Lady Stark is not your mother Making you a bastard Let me give you some advice, bastard Never forget what you are The rest of the world will not Wear it like armor Then it can never be used to hurt you
<name="jon"> What the hell do you know about being a bastard?
<name="tyrion"> All dwarves are bastards in their fathers’ eyes
<name="benjen"> You at a feast It’s like a bear in a trap
<name="ned"> The boy I beheaded Did you know him?
<name="benjen"> Of course I did Just a lad But he was tough, Ned A true Ranger
<name="ned"> He was talking madness Said the Walkers slaughtered his friends
<name="benjen"> The two he was with are still missing
<name="ned"> A wildling ambush
<name="benjen"> Maybe Direwolves south of the wall Talk of the Walkers My brother might be the next Hand to the king Winter is coming
<name="ned"> Winter is coming
<name="robb"> Uncle Benjen
<name="benjen"> Robb boy How are ye?
<name="robb"> I’m good CATELYN Is this your first time in the North, Your Grace?
<name="cersei"> Yes Lovely country
<name="catelyn"> I’m sure it’s very grim, after Kings Landing I remember how scared I was when Ned brought me up here for the first time
<name="cersei"> Hello, little dove But you are a beauty How old are you?
<name="sansa"> Thirteen, Your Grace
<name="cersei"> You’re tall Still growing?
<name="sansa"> I think so, Your Grace
<name="cersei"> And have you bled yet?
<name="sansa"> No, Your Grace
<name="cersei"> And your dress Did you make it?
<name="cersei"> Such talent You must make something for me
<name="cersei"> I hear we might share a grandchild someday
<name="catelyn"> I hear the same
<name="cersei"> Your daughter will do well in the capital Such a beauty shouldn’t stay hidden up here forever
<name="ned"> Your pardon
<name="jaime"> I hear we might be neighbors soon I hope it’s true
<name="ned"> Yes, the king has honored me with his offer
<name="jaime"> I’m sure we’ll have a tournament to celebrate the new title, if you accept It would be good to have you in the field The competition has become a bit stale
<name="ned"> I don’t fight in tournaments
<name="jaime"> No? Getting a little old for it?
<name="ned"> I don’t fight in tournaments because when I fight a man for real, I don’t want him to know what I can do
<name="jaime"> Well said
<name="sansa"> Arya
<name="robb"> Time for bed
<name="ned"> I’m a Northman I belong here with you, not down south in that rat’s nest they call a capital
<name="catelyn"> I won’t let him take you
<name="ned"> The king takes what he wants That’s why he’s king
<name="catelyn"> I’ll say, Listen, fat man, you are not taking my husband anywhere He belongs to me now
<name="ned"> How did he get so fat?
<name="catelyn"> He only stops eating when it’s time for a drink
<name="a voice"> It’s Maester Luwin, my lord
<name="ned"> Send him in
<name="luwin"> Pardon, my lord, my lady A rider in the night from your sister
<name="ned"> Stay
<name="catelyn"> This was sent from the Eyrie What’s she doing at the Eyrie? She hasn’t been back there since her wedding
<name="ned"> What news?
<name="catelyn"> She’s fled the capital She says Jon Arryn was murdered By the Lannisters She says the king is in danger
<name="ned"> She’s fresh widowed, Cat She doesn’t know what she’s saying
<name="catelyn"> Lysa’s head would be on a spike right now if the wrong people had found that letter Do you think she would risk her life, her son’s life, if she wasn’t certain her husband was murdered?
<name="luwin"> If this news is true, and the Lannisters conspire against the throne, who but you can protect the king?
<name="catelyn"> They murdered the last Hand Now you want Ned to take the job
<name="luwin"> The king rode for a month to ask Lord Stark’s help He’s the only one he trusts You swore the king an oath, my lord
<name="catelyn"> He spent half his life fighting Robert’s wars He owes him nothing Your father and brother rode south once on a king’s demand
<name="luwin"> A different time Different king
<name="viserys"> When do I meet with the Khal? We need to begin planning the invasion
<name="illyrio"> If Khal Drogo has promised you a crown, you shall have it
<name="viserys"> When?
<name="illyrio"> When their omens favor war
<name="viserys"> I piss on Dothraki omens I waited 17 years to get my throne back
<name="illyrio"> A Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is considered a dull affair
<name="jorah"> A small gift for the new Khaleesi Songs and histories from the Seven Kingdoms

<name="daenerys"> Thank you, Magister
<name="daenerys"> She’s beautiful Ser Jorah, I don’t know how to say thank you’ in Dothraki
<name="jorah"> There is no word for thank you’ in Dothraki

<name="daenerys"> Do you know the Common Tongue?
<name="khal drogo"> No
<name="daenerys"> Is no’ the only word that you know?
<name="khal drogo"> No
<name="sandor"> Rough night, Imp?
<name="tyrion"> If I get through this without squirting from one end or the other, it will be a miracle
<name="sandor"> I didn’t pick you for a hunter
<name="tyrion"> The greatest in the land My spear never misses
<name="sandor"> It’s not hunting if you pay for it

Season 1
EPISODE "YOU WIN OR YOU DIE" - 29/05/2011


<name="jaime"> Summoned to court to answer for the crimes of your bannerman Gregor Clegane, the Mountain Uh, arrive within the fortnight or be branded an enemy of the Crown Poor Ned Stark Brave man, terrible judgment
<name="tywin"> Attacking him was stupid
<name="tywin"> Lannisters dont act like fools Are you gonna say something clever? Go on, say something clever
<name="jaime"> Catelyn Stark took my brother
<name="tywin"> Why is he still alive?
<name="jaime"> Tyrion?
<name="tywin"> Ned Stark
<name="jaime"> One of our men interfered, speared him through the leg before I could finish him
<name="tywin"> Why is he still alive?
<name="jaime"> It wouldnt have been clean
<name="tywin"> Clean.
<name="tywin"> You spend too much time worrying about what other people think of you
<name="jaime"> I could care less what anyone thinks of me
<name="tywin"> Now thats what you want people to think of you
<name="jaime"> Its the truth
<name="tywin"> When you hear them whispering Kingslayer behind your back, doesnt it bother you?
<name="jaime"> Of course it bothers me
<name="tywin"> The lion doesnt concern himself with the opinions of the sheep I suppose I should be grateful that your vanity got in the way of your recklessness Im giving you half of our forces 30,000 men You will bring them to Catelyn Starks girlhood home and remind her that Lannisters pay their debts
<name="jaime"> I didnt realize you placed such a high value on my brothers life
<name="tywin"> Hes a Lannister He might be the lowest of the Lannisters, but hes one of us And every day that he remains a prisoner, the less our name commands respect
<name="jaime"> So the lion does concern himself with the opinions of
<name="tywin"> No, its not an opinion, its a fact! If another House can seize one of our own and hold him captive with impunity, we are no longer a House to be feared Your mothers dead Before long Ill be dead And you and your brother and your sister and all of her children All of us dead, all of us rotting in the ground Its the family name that lives on Its all that lives on Not your personal glory, not your honor, but family Do you understand?
<name="tywin"> Hmm Youre blessed with abilities that few men possess You are blessed to belong to the most powerful family in the kingdoms And you are still blessed with youth And what have you done with these blessings, huh? Youve served as a glorified bodyguard for two kings One a madman, the other a drunk The future of our family will be determined in these next few months We could establish a dynasty that will last a thousand years Or we could collapse into nothing, as the Targaryens did I need you to become a man you were always meant to be Not next year Not tomorrow Now
<name="cersei"> Youre in pain
<name="ned"> Ive had worse, my lady
<name="cersei"> Perhaps its time to go home
<name="ned"> The South doesnt seem to agree with you
<name="ned"> I know the truth Jon Arryn died for
<name="cersei"> Do you, Lord Stark? Is that why you called me here, to pose me riddles?
<name="ned"> Has he done this before?
<name="cersei"> Jaime would have killed him
<name="cersei"> My brother is worth a thousand of your friend
<name="ned"> Your brother Or your lover?
<name="cersei"> The Targaryens wed brothers and sisters for 300 years to keep bloodlines pure
<name="cersei"> Jaime and I are more than brother and sister We shared a womb We came into this world together We belong together
<name="ned"> My son saw you with him
<name="cersei"> Do you love your children?
<name="ned"> With all my heart
<name="cersei"> No more than I love mine
<name="ned"> And they are all Jaimes
<name="cersei"> Thank the Gods In the rare event that Robert leaves his whores for long enough to stumble drunk into my bed, I finish him off in other ways In the morning, he doesnt remember
<name="ned"> Youve always hated him
<name="cersei"> Hated him? I worshiped him Every girl in the Seven Kingdoms dreamed of him, but he was mine by oath And when I finally saw him on our wedding day in the Sept of Baelor, lean and fierce and black-bearded, it was the happiest moment of my life Then that night he crawled on top of me, stinking of wine and did what he did, what little he could do, and whispered in my ear, Lyanna Your sister was a corpse and I was a living girl and he loved her more than me
<name="ned"> When the King returns from his hunt, Ill tell him the truth You must be gone by then You and your children I will not have their blood on my hands Go as far away as you can, with as many men as you can Because wherever you go, Roberts wrath will follow you
<name="cersei"> And what of my wrath, Lord Stark? You should have taken the realm for yourself Jaime told me about the day Kings Landing fell He was sitting in the Iron Throne and you made him give it up All you needed to do was climb the steps yourself Such a sad mistake
<name="ned"> Ive made many mistakes in my life, but that wasnt one of them
<name="cersei"> Oh, but it was When you play the Game of Thrones, you win or you die There is no middle ground
<name="ros"> Come here Oh yes, oh Oh yes yes yes
<name="littlefinger"> No no no no! Is that what they teach you up in the North? And you wherever youre from, do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound? Either of you understand a thing that Im saying?
<name="ros"> Yes, My Lord
<name="littlefinger"> Lets start over, shall we? You be the man and you be the woman Well, go ahead Slowly Youre not fooling them They just paid you They know what you are They know its all just an act Your job is to make them forget what they know That takes time You need to Ease into it Go ahead Ease into it Hes winning you over in spite of yourself Youre starting to like this He wants to believe you Hes enjoyed his cock since he was old enough to play with it Why shouldnt you? He knows hes better than other men Hes always known it deep down inside Now he has proof Hes so good, hes reaching something deep inside of you that no one even knew was there Overcoming your very nature
<name="ros"> Why dont you join us, My Lord?
<name="littlefinger"> Im saving myself for another
<name="ros"> What she doesnt know wont hurt her
<name="littlefinger"> A stupid saying What we dont know is usually what gets us killed
<name="ros"> She must be very beautiful
<name="littlefinger"> No, not really Impeccable bloodlines though
<name="ros"> I do believe my lords in love
<name="littlefinger"> For many years Most of my life really Play with her ass And she loved me too I was her little confidant, her plaything She could tell me anything, anything at all She told me about all the horses that she liked The castle she wanted to live in and the man that she wanted to marry A northerner with a jaw like an anvil So I challenged him to a duel I mean, why not? Id read all the stories The little hero always beats the big villain in all the stories In the end, she wouldnt even let him kill me Hes just a boy , she said Please dont hurt him So he gave me a nice little scar to remember him by, and off they went
<name="ros"> Is she still married to him?
<name="littlefinger"> Oh no He got himself killed before the wedding And she ended up with his brother, an even more impressive specimen She loves him, Im afraid And why wouldnt she? I mean, who could compare to him? Hes just so good Do you know what I learned, losing that duel? I learned that Ill never win Not that way Thats their game, their rules Im not going to fight them Im going to fuck them Thats what I know Thats what I am And only by admitting what we are can we get what we want
<name="ros"> And what do you want?
<name="littlefinger"> Oh, everything, my dear Everything there is Now wash yourselves Both of you are working tonight Hmm
<name="sraw theon"> Youre a very lucky girl Do you know that? Where I come from, we dont show mercy to criminals Where I come from, if someone like you attacked a little lord, at low tide wed lay you on your back on the beach, your hands and feet chained to four stakes The sea would come in closer and closer Youd see death creeping toward you a few inches at a time
<name="osha"> Where is it you come from?
<name="theon"> The Iron Islands
<name="osha"> They far away?
<name="theon"> Youve never heard of the Iron Islands?

<name="barristan selmy"> His squire, from the kings own skin
<name="ned"> His squire? The Lannister boy?
<name="varys"> Such a dutiful boy to make sure his Grace did not lack refreshment I do hope the poor lad does not blame himself
<name="ned"> His Grace has had a change of heart concerning Daenerys Targaryen Whatever arrangements you made, unmake them At once
<name="varys"> Im afraid those birds have flown.The girl is likely dead already
<name="khal drogo"> The stallion who mounts the world, has no need for iron chairs
<name="daenerys"> According to the prophecy, the stallions will ride to the ends of the world
<name="khal drogo"> The earth ends at the black salt sea No horse can cross the poison water
<name="daenerys"> The earth does not end at the sea, there are many dirts beyond the sea The dirt where I was born
<name="khal drogo"> Not dirt Lands
<name="daenerys"> Lands, yes There are thousands of ships in the free cities Wooden horses that fly across the sea
<name="khal drogo"> Lets speak no more of wooden horses and iron chairs
<name="daenerys"> Its not a chair Its a.
<name="thronekhal drogo"> Throne?
<name="daenerys"> A chair for a King to sit upon, or a Queen
<name="khal drogo"> A King does not need a chair to sit upon He only needs a horse
<name="daenerys"> Cant you help me make him understand?
<name="jorah"> The Dothraki do things in their own time, for their own reasons Have patience, Khaleesi We will go home, I promise you
<name="daenerys"> My brother was a fool, I know, but he was the rightful heir to the Seven Kingdoms Have I said something funny, Ser?
<name="jorah"> Forgive me, Khaleesi, but your ancestor Aegon the Conqueror didnt seize six of the kingdoms because they were his right He had no right to them He seized them because he could
<name="daenerys"> And because he had dragons
<name="jorah"> Ah well, having a few dragons makes things easier
<name="daenerys"> You dont believe it
<name="jorah"> Have you ever seen a dragon, Khaleesi? I believe what my eyes and ears report As for the rest It was 300 years ago Who knows what really happened? Now if youll pardon me, Ill seek out the merchant Captain, see if he has any letters for me
<name="daenerys"> Well, Ill come with you
<name="jorah"> No no, dont trouble yourself Enjoy the market Ill rejoin you soon enough
<name="little bird"> Psst, Jorah the Andal The spider sends his greetings and his congratulations A royal pardon You can go home now
<name="wine merchant"> Virzetha gizikhven! Mra qora! Mra qora
<name="daenerys"> My son already has his name, but Ill try your summerwine Just a taste
<name="wine merchant"> My Lady, you are from Westeros
<name="doreah"> You have the honor of addressing Daenerys of the House Targaryen Khaleesi of the riding men and princess of the Seven Kingdoms
<name="wine merchant"> Princess
<name="daenerys"> Rise Id still like to taste that wine
<name="wine merchant"> That? Dornish swill Not worthy of a princess I have a dry red from the Arbor Nectar of the Gods Let me give you a cask Uh a gift
<name="daenerys"> You honor me, Ser
<name="wine merchant"> The honor the honor is all mine
<name="rakharo"> Huh-uh, huh-uh
<name="wine merchant"> You know there are many in your homeland that pray for your return, princess
<name="daenerys"> I hope to repay your kindness someday
<name="rakharo"> Huh
<name="daenerys"> Is something wrong?
<name="jorah"> I have a thirst Open it
<name="wine merchant"> The wine is for the Khaleesi Its not for the likes of you
<name="jorah"> Open it
<name="jorah"> Pour
<name="wine merchant"> It would be a crime to drink a wine this rich without at least giving it time to breathe
<name="daenerys"> Do as he says
<name="wine merchant"> As the princess commands
<name="wine merchant"> Sweet, isnt it? Can you smell the fruit, Ser? Taste it, My Lord Tell me that that is not the finest wine that has ever touched your tongue
<name="jorah"> You first
<name="wine merchant"> Me? Im afraid I am not worthy of the vintage Besides, it is a poor wine merchant who would drink up his own wares
<name="daenerys"> You will drink
<name="doreah"> Khaleesi! Stop him
<name="jorah"> Come Not much, really But theres food
<name="jeor"> Here you begin anew A man of The Nights Watch lives his life for the realm Not for a king, or a lord, or the honor of this house or that house Not for gold nor glory nor a womans love But for the realm! And all the people in it Youve all learned the words of the vow Think carefully before you say them The penalty for desertion, is death You can take your vows here tonight, at sunset Do any of you still keep the old Gods?
<name="jon"> I do, my lord
<name="jeor"> Youll want to take your vow before a heart tree as your Uncle did
<name="jon"> Yes, my lord
<name="jeor"> Youll find a Weirwood a mile North of the Wall And your old Gods too, maybe
<name="sam"> my lord, might I go as well?
<name="jeor"> Does house Tarly keep the old Gods?
<name="sam"> No, my lord I was named in the light of the Seven, as my father was and his father before him.Alliser ThorneL Why would you forsake the Gods of your father and your house?
<name="sam"> The Nights Watch is my house now The Seven have never answered my prayers Perhaps the old Gods will
<name="jeor"> As you wish, lad Youve all been assigned an order, according to our needs and your strengths Halder to the builders Pyp to the stewards Toad to the builders Grenn to the Rangers Samwell to the stewards Matthar to the Rangers Dareon to the stewards Balian to the Rangers Rast to the Rangers Jon to the stewards Rancer to the builders Echiel to the builders Gordo to the stewards Niko to the Rangers Escan to the Rangers Vorkoy to the builders Joby to the stables Mink to the kitchens Allo to the builders Nelugo to the Rangers May all the Gods preserve you
<name="jaremy rykker"> Rangers with me
<name="othell yarwyck"> Builders
<name="maester aemon"> Samwell, you will assist me in the rookery and library Pyp, you will report to Bowen Marsh in the kitchens Luke, report to one-eyed Joe in the stables Dareon, we are sending you to Eastwatch Present yourself to Borcas when you arrive Make no comment about his nose , Lord Commander Mormont has requested you for his personal steward
<name="jon"> Will I serve the Lord Commanders meals and fetch hot water for his bath
<name="maester aemon"> Certainly And keep a fire burning in his chambers Change his sheets and blankets daily and do everything else the Lord Commander requires of you
<name="jon"> Do you take me for a servant?
<name="maester aemon"> We took you for a man of The Nights Watch But perhaps we were wrong in that
<name="jon"> May I go?
<name="maester aemon"> As you wish
<name="sam"> Jon, wait! Dont you see what theyre doing?
<name="jon"> I see Ser Allisers revenge, thats all He wanted it and he got it Stewards are nothing but maids! Im a better swordsman and rider than any of you! Its not fair
<name="pypar"> Fair? I was singing for a high lord at Acorn Hall when he put his hand on my leg and he wanted to see my cock I pushed him away and he said hed have my hands cut off for stealing their silver So now Im here At the end of the world with no one to sing for, but old men and little shits like you Ill never see my family again Ill never be inside a woman again So dont tell me about fair
<name="sam"> I thought you were caught stealing a wheel of cheese for your starving sister?
<name="pypar"> You think I was gonna tell a bunch of strangers that a high lord tried to grab my cock?
<name="sam"> Could you sing me a song, Pyp? Id like to hear a song
<name="sam"> Now listen to me The old man is the Lord Commander of The Nights Watch Youll be with him day and night Yes, youll clean his clothes.But youll also take his letters, attend him at meetings, squire for him in battle Youll know everything, be part of everything And he asked for you himself He wants to groom you for command
<name="jon"> I just, I always wanted to be a Ranger
<name="sam"> I always wanted to be a Wizard What? No, Im serious So youll stay and say your words with me?
<name="renly"> She wont care Give me an hour and I can put a hundred swords at your command
<name="ned"> And what should I do with a hundred swords?
<name="renly"> Strike! Tonight while the castle sleeps We must get Joffrey away from his mother and into our custody Protector of the Realm or no, he who holds the King holds the Kingdom Every moment you delay gives Cersei another moment to prepare By the time Robert dies, it will be too late for the both of us
<name="ned"> What about Stannis?
<name="renly"> Saving the Seven Kingdoms from Cersei and delivering them to Stannis? You have odd notions about protecting the realm
<name="ned"> Stannis is your older brother
<name="renly"> This isnt about the bloody line of succession That didnt matter when you rebelled against the Mad King It shouldnt matter now Whats best for the Kingdoms? Whats best for the people we rule? We all know what Stannis is He inspires no love or loyalty Hes not a King I am
<name="ned"> Stannis is a commander Hes led men into war twice He destroyed the Greyjoy fleet
<name="renly"> Yes, hes a good soldier Everyone knows that So was Robert
<name="tell me something"> Do you still believe good soldiers make good kings?
<name="ned"> I will not dishonor Roberts last hours by shedding blood in his halls and dragging frightened children from their beds
<name="ned"> You will sail to dragonstone tonight You will place this in the hand of Stannis Baratheon Not his steward, not his Captain of the guard, and not his wife Only Stannis himself
<name="tomard"> Yes, My Lord
<name="ned"> Now leave us
<name="littlefinger"> My Lord protector
<name="ned"> ing has no true born sons Joffrey and Tommen are Jaime Lannisters bastards
<name="littlefinger"> So when the King dies.
<name="ned"> The throne passes to his brother Lord Stannis
<name="littlefinger"> So it would seem Unless.
<name="ned"> There is no unless He is the rightful heir Nothing can change that
<name="littlefinger"> And he cannot take the throne without your help You would be wise to deny it to him and to make sure Joffrey succeeds
<name="ned"> Do you have a shred of honor?
<name="littlefinger"> You are now Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm All of the power is yours You need only reach out and take it Make peace with the Lannisters Release the Imp Wed your daughter to Joffrey We have plenty of time to get rid of Stannis And if Joffrey seems likely to cause problems when he comes into his throne, we simply reveal his little secret and seat Lord Renly there instead
<name="ned"> We?
<name="littlefinger"> Youll need someone to share these burdens I assure you, my price would be modest
<name="ned"> What you suggest is treason
<name="littlefinger"> Only if we lose
<name="ned"> Make peace with the Lannisters, you say With the people who tried to murder my boy
<name="ned"> No I wont do it
<name="littlefinger"> So it will be Stannis and war?
<name="ned"> There is no other choice He is the heir
<name="littlefinger"> So why did you call me here? Not for my wisdom, clearly
<name="ned"> You promised Catelyn you would help me The Queen has a dozen knights and a hundred men-at-arms Enough to overwhelm what remains of my household guard I need the gold cloaks The City Watch is 2,000 strong and sworn to defend the Kings peace
<name="littlefinger"> Look at you You know what you want me to do You know it has to be done, but its not honorable so the words stick in your throat When the Queen proclaims one King and the Hand proclaims another, whose peace do the Gold Cloaks protect? Who do they follow? The man who pays them
<name="daenerys"> I thought hed leave me alone, now that my brother is gone.He will never leave you alone If you ride to darkest Asshai, his assassins will follow you If you sailed all the way to the Basilisk Isles, his spies would tell him He will never abandon the hunt Youre a Targaryen The last Targaryen Your son will have Targaryen blood with 40,000 riders behind him
<name="daenerys"> He will not have my son
<name="khal drogo"> Moon of my life Are you hurt?
<name="khal drogo"> Jorah the Andal, I heard what you did Choose any horse you wish, it is yours.I make this gift to you And to my son, the stallion who will mount the world I will also pledge a gift
<name="king joffrey"> Liar
<name="cersei"> You condemn yourself with your own mouth, Lord Stark Ser Barristan, seize this traitor
<name="ned"> Ser Barristan is a good man, a loyal man Do him no harm
<name="cersei"> You think he stands alone?
<name="king joffrey"> Kill him! Kill all of them, I command it
<name="ned"> Commander! Take the Queen and her children into custody Escort them back to the royal apartments and keep them there, under guard
<name="janos slynt"> Men of the Watch
<name="ned"> I want no bloodshed Tell your men to lay down their swords No one needs to die
<name="littlefinger"> Now

<name="jon"> There are no women of the Nights Watch, no
<name="ygritte"> So the lads just do it with each other?
<name="jon"> No

<name="ygritte"> Would you please shut up? You think youre better than me, crow Im a free woman
<name="jon"> Youre a free woman? I might be your prisoner, but Im a free woman
<name="jon"> If youre my prisoner, youre not a free woman Thats what prisoner means
<name="ygritte"> And you think youre free? You swore some stupid oath and now you can never touch a girl
<name="jon"> It was my choice to say the words
<name="ygritte"> So you dont like girls?
<name="jon"> Of course I like girls But you chose never to touch them
<name="jon"> Thats the price you pay if you want to be a man of the Nights Watch
<name="ygritte"> So instead of getting naked with a girl, youd prefer to invade our lands
<name="jon"> Invade your lands? Wildlings raid our lands all the time Some of them tried to kill my little brother, a crippled boy
<name="ygritte"> Yheyre not your lands! Weve been here the whole time You lot came along and just put up a big wall and said it was yours

<name="tywin"> Pretentious name for a band of outlaws We cant allow rebels behind our lines to harass us with impunity We look like fools and they look like heroes Thats how kings fall I want them dead, every one
<name="mountain"> Killing them isnt the problem Its finding them Have you gone soft, Clegane? I always thought you had a talent for violence

<name="tywin"> Mmm This will be my last war Win or lose
<name="arya"> Have you ever lost before?
<name="tywin"> Do you think Id be in my position if I had lost a war?
<name="tywin"> But this is the one Ill be remembered for The War of Five Kings, theyre calling it My legacy will be determined in the coming months
<name="tywin"> Do you know what legacy means? Its what you pass down to your children and your childrens children Its what remains of you when youre gone Harren the Black thought this castle would be his legacy The greatest fortress ever built The tallest towers, the strongest walls The Great Hall had 35 hearths Thirty-five Can you imagine? Look at it now A blasted ruin Do you know what happened?
<name="arya"> Dragons?
<name="tywin"> Yes Dragons happened
<name="tywin"> Harrenhal was built to withstand an attack from the land A million men could have marched on these walls, and a million men would have been repelled But an attack from the air with dragon fire Mmm-mmm Harren and all his sons roasted alive within these walls Aegon Targaryen changed the rules Thats why every child alive still knows his name
<name="arya"> Aegon and his sisters
<name="tywin"> Mmm?
<name="arya"> It wasnt just Aegon riding his dragon It was Rhaenys and Visenya, too
<name="tywin"> Correct A student of history, are you?
<name="arya"> Rhaenys rode Meraxes Visenya rode Vhagar
<name="tywin"> Im sure I knew that when I was a boy
<name="arya"> Visenya Targaryen was a great warrior She had a Valyrian steel sword she called Dark Sister
<name="tywin"> Hmm Shes a heroine of yours, I take it?
<name="tywin"> Arent most girls more interested in the pretty maidens from the songs? Jonquil with the flowers in her hair?
<name="arya"> Most girls are idiots
<name="tywin"> You remind me of my daughter Where did you learn all this stuff about Visenya and her Valyrian steel sword?
<name="arya"> From my father
<name="tywin"> He was a well-read stonemason Cant say Ive ever met a literate stonemason
<name="arya"> Have you met many stonemasons, my lord?
<name="tywin"> Careful now, girl I enjoy you, but be careful Take that back to the kitchen Eat what you want
<name="tywin"> And, girl
<name="tywin"> Mlord
<name="tywin"> Lowborn girls say mlord, not my lord If youre going to pose as a commoner, you should do it properly
<name="arya"> My mother served Lady Dustin for many years, my lord She taught me how to speak proper Properly
<name="tywin"> Youre too smart for your own good Has anyone told you that?
<name="arya"> Yes
<name="tywin"> Go on
<name="sansa"> I beg pardon, ser I should have come to you after to thank you for saving me You were so brave
<name="sandor"> Brave? A dog doesnt need courage to chase off rats
<name="sansa"> Does it give you joy to scare people?
<name="sandor"> No, it gives me joy to kill people
<name="sandor"> Spare me You cant tell me Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell never killed a man
<name="sansa"> It was his duty He never liked it
<name="sandor"> Is that what he told you? He lied Killing is the sweetest thing there is
<name="sansa"> Why are you always so hateful?
<name="sandor"> Youll be glad of the hateful things I do someday when youre queen and Im all that stands between you and your beloved king
<name="xaro"> Ive demanded a meeting of the Thirteen One of them did this or knows who did
<name="daenerys"> You are one of the Thirteen
<name="xaro"> If I wanted your dragons, I would have taken them They mean nothing to me on their own
<name="daenerys"> Nothing? Theyre more valuable than anything in the world
<name="xaro"> Shall we look inside my vault and see what selling your dragons would buy me I cannot buy already? We will get them back
<name="daenerys"> There is no we, so why would you help me get them back?
<name="xaro"> I took you under my protection in front of the rulers of my city A man is what others say he is and no more If they say that Xaro Xhoan Daxos is a liar, my word is worth nothing I cannot let this thing happen to you under my roof
<name="daenerys"> But it did happen under your roof
<name="xaro"> Khaleesi, many times in my life
<name="daenerys"> I dont care where youve been
<name="ygritte"> You think were savages because we dont live in stone castles We cant make steel as good as yours, its true, but Were free If someone tried to tell us we couldnt lie down as man and woman, wed shove a spear up his arse We dont go serving some shit king whos only king because his father was
<name="jon"> No No, you serve Mance Rayder, the King beyond the Wall
<name="ygritte"> We chose Mance Rayder to lead us He was a crow, same as you, but he wanted to be free You could be free, too You dont need to live your whole life taking commands from old men Wake up when you want to wake up I could show you the streams to fish, the woods to hunt Build yourself a cabin and find a woman to lie with in the night
<name="ygritte"> Youre a pretty lad The girls would claw each others eyes out to get naked with you
<name="jon"> Walk
<name="ygritte"> I could teach you how to do it
<name="jon"> I know how to do it
<name="ygritte"> You know nothing, Jon Snow
<name="robb"> And what did she say?
<name="alton"> She admired your spirit, Your Grace
<name="robb"> And what then?
<name="she robb"> If every man were held accountable for the actions of every distant relative, Ser Alton, wed all hang
<name="alton"> She tore the paper in half, Your Grace
<name="robb"> Youve acted with honor I thank you for it Lord Karstark, see that Ser Altons pen is clean, and give him a hot supper
<name="rickard kar"> Ser Altons pen is occupied, Your Grace The prisoners from the Yellow Fork
<name="roose"> Too many prisoners
<name="robb"> Is there room for Ser Alton?
<name="rickard kar"> Does he need to lie down?
<name="robb"> Have the men build him a new pen Put him in with the Kingslayer for now Have your boy watch over them
<name="rickard kar"> Torrhen
<name="robb"> That will be all
<name="talisa"> Your Grace A minute of your time?
<name="talisa"> Ive been treating your wounded men
<name="robb"> And my enemies, as some of my bannermen are fond of mentioning
<name="talisa"> Theyre not my enemies
<name="robb"> Thats what I tell my bannermen
<name="talisa"> Ive already run through the supplies I brought with me Some are easily replaced Egg yolks, turpentine, oil of roses But some are not I need silk for stitching I need fennel root for those with fever, willow bark Mostly I need milk of the poppy You saw what it was like to amputate a foot without any I assume there will be more loss of limb before this war is over
<name="robb"> If you need help finding these
<name="talisa"> I know where to find them Im sorry, I shouldnt interrupt you
<name="robb"> Continue, my lady
<name="talisa"> Youre riding to the Crag to negotiate a surrender?
<name="robb"> Yes
<name="talisa"> The Crag will have a maester and he will have what I need
<name="robb"> I expect he will
<name="talisa"> If I could write a list
<name="robb"> Come with me to the Crag
<name="talisa"> I dont think that will be
<name="robb"> Let the maester show you his stores I want the wounded men to be treated well, all the wounded men
<name="woman"> Children, come inside, quick Come on
<name="child"> Hurry up
<name="man"> Cant find anything, ser Theyve lost the scent
<name="theon"> Try again
<name="man"> Weve circled this farmhouse twice Theres no sign of them
<name="luwin"> We could start the search fresh in the morning, my lord
<name="theon"> Im looking at spending the rest of my life being treated like a fool and a eunuch by my own people Ask yourself, is there anything I wouldnt do to stop that from happening? The hounds will find the scent again Ill beat them until they do Ill whip every man here until I have both those boys in hand And once Ive got them, the pampered little shits Its better to be cruel than weak
<name="man"> Prince Theon
<name="theon"> Where are they?
<name="winterfell shepherd"> Who, mlord?
<name="theon"> The Stark boys Where are they?
<name="winterfell shepherd"> I dont know I seen no one
<name="theon"> Think harder
<name="winterfell shepherd"> I swear, mlord I dont know
<name="dagmer"> My lord, over here I think Ive found what were looking for
<name="dagmer"> Send the old man home
<name="theon"> Go back to Winterfell Take him back
<name="luwin"> Theon, dont do this
<name="daenerys"> You came back
<name="jorah"> As soon as I heard Do you know anything?
<name="daenerys"> Irri is dead
<name="jorah"> I know She was a good
<name="daenerys"> Shes dead She died alone She died for me and I couldnt protect her
<name="jorah"> Doreah?
<name="daenerys"> We cant find her She must be dead, too I led my people out of the Red Waste and into the slaughterhouse
<name="jorah"> I should have been here
<name="daenerys"> You went to find me a ship
<name="jorah"> My place is by your side I shouldnt have left you alone with these people
<name="daenerys"> These people ?
<name="jorah"> They are not to be trusted
<name="daenerys"> And who is to be trusted? Who are my people? The Targaryens? I only knew one, my brother, and he would have let a thousand men rape me if it had got him the crown The Dothraki? Most of them turned on me the day that Khal Drogo fell from his horse
<name="jorah"> Your people are in Westeros
<name="daenerys"> The people in Westeros dont know Im alive
<name="jorah"> They will soon enough
<name="daenerys"> And then what? Theyll pray for my return? Theyll wave dragon banners and shout my name? Thats what my brother believed and he was a fool
<name="daenerys"> You are not your brother
<name="jorah"> Trust me, Khaleesi
<name="daenerys"> There it is Trust me And its you I should trust, Ser Jorah? Only you? I dont need trust any longer I dont want it and I dont have room for it
<name="jorah"> You are too young to be so
<name="daenerys"> And you are too familiar
<name="jorah"> Forgive me, Khaleesi No one can survive in this world without help No one Let me help you, please Tell me how
<name="daenerys"> Find my dragons
<name="ygritte"> How long till we get back to your crows?
<name="jon"> Were close
<name="ygritte"> What, a day? A half-day? You dont know, do you? Do you even know where they are?
<name="jon"> Were close
<name="ygritte"> What do you think theyll say when they hear about you and me?
<name="jon"> Nothing happened between you and me
<name="ygritte"> I swear it, Old Master King Crow, ser, we were only close together for warmth And then I felt it, right up against me backside like a club I can show you the bruise on me tailbone And before I knew what was where, his his Well, it was all out in the open, all angry as you like And I didnt want to want it, but oh, I did! And he spread me legs and ruined The shame of it Now I can never marry a perfumed lord What will me poor savage father say?
<name="jon"> Turn back around
<name="ygritte"> And I thought that we were done, but he said, Turn back around Ill tell you what, Jon Snow Since its gonna be your word against mine, and since you cant talk about it without blushing, we may as well just
<name="jon"> What, right here in the muck?
<name="ygritte"> Ill keep you warm enough
<name="ygritte"> Are you that afraid of it?
<name="jon"> Thats enough
<name="ygritte"> Its nice and wet and warm
<name="jon"> Enough
<name="ygritte"> It dont have teeth
<name="ygritte"> All right! All right Gods, youre dull
<name="ygritte"> Should have took me while you had the chance
<name="sansa"> No, no
<name="sansa"> No Oh, no
<name="shae"> Its all right Give me that
<name="sansa"> If the Queen sees, I can have Joffreys children now
<name="shae"> Help me flip it over
<name="shae"> Where are you going?
<name="handmaiden"> To tell Her Grace
<name="shae"> Youll say nothing to anyone Do you understand?
<name="cersei"> Your mother might have prepared you You flowered, my dear No more
<name="sansa"> My mother told me, but I thought it would be different
<name="cersei"> In what way?
<name="sansa"> I thought it would be less Less messy
<name="cersei"> Wait until you birth a child
<name="cersei"> Youre a woman now Do you have any idea what that means?
<name="sansa"> Im fit to bear children for the king?
<name="cersei"> A prospect that once delighted you, bringing little princes and princesses into the world, the greatest honor for a queen
<name="cersei"> Joffrey has always been difficult Even his birth, I labored a day and a half to bring him into this world You cannot imagine the pain I screamed so loudly, I was sure Robert would hear me in the Kingswood
<name="sansa"> His Grace was not with you?
<name="cersei"> Robert was hunting That was his custom Whenever my time was near, my royal husband would flee to the trees with his huntsmen and his hounds And when he returned, he would present me with some pelts or a stags head, and I would present him with a baby Not that I wanted him there, mind you I had Grand Maester Pycelle, an army of midwives, and I had my brother When they told Jaime he wasnt allowed in the birthing room, he smiled and asked which one of them proposed to keep him out Joffrey will show you no such devotion
<name="cersei"> You may never love the king, but you will love his children
<name="sansa"> I love His Grace with all my heart
<name="cersei"> Thats so very touching to hear Permit me to share some womanly wisdom with you on this very special day The more people you love, the weaker you are Youll do things for them that you know you shouldnt do Youll act the fool to make them happy, to keep them safe Love no one but your children On that front, a mother has no choice
<name="sansa"> But shouldnt I love Joffrey, Your Grace?
<name="cersei"> You can try, little dove
<name="cersei"> Who did you say your mother was again?
<name="alton"> Cinda Lannister
<name="jaime"> Is she the fat one?
<name="alton"> Well, perhaps shes gotten a little larger than she
<name="jaime"> No, no Theres only one fat Lannister If she was your mother, youd know it
<name="alton"> I squired for you once, you know
<name="jaime"> When?
<name="alton"> The tournament, the day of Willem Freys wedding
<name="jaime"> I went to Willem Freys wedding?
<name="alton"> You did Your squire had gotten so drunk the night before that he threw up
<name="jaime"> He threw up on his horse on the way to the tourney grounds What was his name?
<name="alton"> Bryan
<name="jaime"> Poor lad That was my brothers doing, I seem to recall I remember you Youd never squired for anyone before
<name="alton"> Thats right I ran up and volunteered Let me, my lord Let me My father was furious Afraid Id embarrass our family in front of the Family
<name="jaime"> You didnt, though
<name="alton"> You really remember?
<name="jaime"> You knew when you were needed and when to go away Its a rare talent Most of my squires, they mean well, but young men with big jobs, they tend to overdo them
<name="alton"> When I think back to that day
<name="guard"> Shh
<name="jaime"> You were saying?
<name="alton"> I Never mind Its embarrassing
<name="jaime"> More embarrassing than being chained to a post covered in your own shit?
<name="alton"> I remember everything about that day, your helmet, your horse, the rake lines in the dirt along the list, where the sun was in the sky when you knocked Balon from his horse, and the dent in your shield when you handed it back to me Ill remember it all until I die That was the best day of my life And I remember being on the field after it was over All the competitors were done I was the last one out there And I couldnt leave I couldnt bring myself to go and sit with my family at a table so far on the edge of the feast you could barely even see the bride And I couldnt bear to tell them what it had been like squiring for you, when I knew that they could never have the faintest idea what I was talking about
<name="jaime"> I understand completely
<name="alton"> How could you? Sorry, I I didnt mean to doubt you
<name="jaime"> Its just that I I was 16 once I also had to replace someones squire on short notice
<name="alton"> Which knight was it?
<name="jaime"> Barristan Selmy The fight against the Kingswood Outlaws Before your time
<name="alton"> What was he like?
<name="jaime"> He was A painter A painter who only used red I couldnt imagine being able to fight like that, not back then And to help him do that, to be a part of something that perfect I dont need to explain how that felt, not to you
<name="alton"> Its hard to put into words
<name="jaime"> Its like stepping into a dream youve been dreaming for as long as you can remember, and finding out that the dream is more real than your life
<name="alton"> Leaving that battlefield was like being dragged off to prison
<name="alton"> Did you squire for him again?
<name="jaime"> No I didnt have your gift He couldnt take a step without stepping on me I was awful, a complete liability Until one of the outlaws decided to take on a 16-year-old squire
<name="jaime"> Its a good thing I am who I am Id have been useless at anything else Im not well-suited for imprisonment Shocking, I know Some men are Ned Stark, I imagine he made an excellent prisoner right up until the end Not me, though My life has left me uniquely unfit for constraint
<name="alton"> And have you thought about
<name="jaime"> Of course Every day
<name="alton"> And?
<name="jaime"> Good prisoners breed good jailers, apparently The Starks are very careful
<name="jaime"> But there is a way, I think It wasnt possible until now
<name="alton"> What is it?
<name="jaime"> Its actually quite simple
<name="alton"> Well, let me help you
<name="jaime"> Youll only have to do one thing
<name="alton"> Tell me
<name="jaime"> Youll have to die
<name="quaith"> Jorah the Andal This man must sail past old Valyria All who travel too close to the doom must have protection
<name="jorah"> I didnt come here for lessons
<name="quaith"> No, you came for the dragons
<name="jorah"> You have them? Where are they?
<name="quaith"> Draw your sword See what your steel is worth You want to please the Mother of Dragons
<name="quaith"> You love her
<name="jorah"> Where are the dragons?
<name="quaith"> Will you betray her again, Jorah the Andal?
<name="quaith"> Will you betray her again?
<name="jorah"> Never
<name="quaith"> The thief you seek is with her now
<name="spice king"> I did not leave the comfort of my home to come to yours and be called a thief
<name="xaro"> No one is calling you a thief Who is she to accuse us?
<name="daenerys"> Please, theyre my children Im begging you
<name="silk king"> Begging us? It wasnt very long ago you were threatening us
<name="daenerys"> Without me, the dragons will die
<name="spice king"> It will be for the best Your dragons will bring the world nothing but death and misery, my dear If I knew where they were, I would not tell you
<name="pyat pree"> You are cruel, my friend The Mother of Dragons is in the right She must be reunited with her babies I will help you, Khaleesi
<name="daenerys"> How?
<name="pyatt pree"> I will take you to the House of the Undying where I have put them
<name="daenerys"> You have my dragons?
<name="pyatt pree"> When I learned you were coming to our city, I made an arrangement with the King of Qarth He procured them for me
<name="daenerys"> But there is no King of Qarth
<name="xaro"> There is now That was the other half of the arrangement
<name="xaro"> You would keep your gates and your minds closed to everything outside your walls, but Qarth cannot remain the greatest city that ever was if it refuses to change I will open Qarth to the world as I have forced it to open itself to me
<name="spice king"> Your ambition is an inspiration But like all upstarts, you overreach Three dragons the size of cats and an alliance with a charlatan do not make you a king
<name="xaro"> An upstart and a charlatan? Empires have been built by less Those on the margins often come to control the center, and those in the center make room for them, willingly or otherwise
<name="pyatt pree"> The Mother of Dragons will be with her babies She will give them her love and they will thrive by her side, forever
<name="pyatt pree"> A mother should be with her children
<name="pyatt pree"> Where will you run to, Daenerys Stormborn? Your dragons wait for you in the House of the Undying Come see them
<name="jacks"> Lady Stark
<name="brienne"> No farther
<name="jacks"> Keep your hands off me, woman
<name="brienne"> Dont enter without an invitation, man
<name="jacks"> Forgive me Lady Stark
<name="catelyn"> What is it?
<name="jacks"> They caught the Kingslayer
<name="man"> Kingslayer
<name="man"> Kill the fucking Kingslayer
<name="man"> Hang him
<name="man"> Hang him
<name="man"> Youll die today
<name="man"> Justice for the Karstark
<name="man"> Gut him
<name="rickard kar"> Get back! I want his head! Any man who stands between a father and his vengeance asks for death
<name="catelyn"> Lord Karstark, this man is our prisoner
<name="rickard"> This monster killed my son
<name="catelyn"> And crippled mine He will answer for his crimes, I promise you, but not here
<name="rickard kar"> I will have his head And if you try and stop me
<name="catelyn"> You will strike me down? Have you forgotten me, ser? I am the widow of your liege, Lord Eddard Stark I am the mother of your king
<name="rickard kar"> And where is our king now?
<name="robb"> You know very well
<name="rickard kar"> He has gone to the Crag to accept the surrender Aye, gone to the Crag, but not to negotiate He brought that foreign bitch with him
<name="catelyn"> How dare you
<name="brienne"> Threatening my lady is an act of treason
<name="rickard kar"> Treason? How can it be treason to kill Lannisters?
<name="catelyn"> I understand your grief, my lord, better than most, I understand it But in the name of my son, the King in the North, stand down
<name="rickard kar"> When your son returns, I will demand this murderers head
<name="catelyn"> Wise men do not make demands of kings
<name="rickard kar"> Fathers who love their sons do I will have his head
<name="jaime"> Thank you for fighting on my behalf, Lady Stark I would have come to your defense
<name="but catelyn"> Take him to the stockades Bind him with every chain you can find
<name="jaime"> Youve become a real she-wolf in your later years Theres not much fish left in you
<name="catelyn"> And gag him
<name="tyrion"> Since when do you light your own candles?
<name="cersei"> Since I decided that I cant stand to look at any of my handmaidens for another instant
<name="cersei"> How many times can you read one raven scroll?
<name="tyrion"> Stannis Baratheons fleet has been spotted sailing north past Tarth, 200 ships
<name="cersei"> More than we have
<name="tyrion"> Yes, thats more than we have Hell be at our gates within five days, four if he has the wind
<name="cersei"> We have strong, high walls Well rain fire down on them from above
<name="tyrion"> Rain fire on them from above Youre quoting Father, arent you?
<name="cersei"> Why not? He has a good mind for strategy, doesnt he?
<name="tyrion"> Call it tactics, not strategy But, yes, he does have a good mind for it The best mind, some would say Sadly, hes not here Its just you, me and Joffrey, the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm
<name="cersei"> Im sure youll make a point eventually
<name="tyrion"> He needs to start acting like a king This war you started is coming to our doorstep And if the entire city wants Joffrey dead
<name="cersei"> Im not the one giving the boy whores to abuse
<name="tyrion"> I thought the girls might help him
<name="cersei"> Did you?
<name="tyrion"> I was wrong If we cant control him
<name="cersei"> Do you think I havent tried? He doesnt listen to me
<name="tyrion"> Its hard to put a leash on a dog once youve put a crown on its head
<name="cersei"> I always hoped hed be like Jaime He looks like him In a certain light
<name="tyrion"> The boy is more Robert than Jaime
<name="cersei"> Robert was a drunken fool, but he didnt enjoy cruelty Sometimes I wonder What? If this is the price for what weve done, for our sins
<name="tyrion"> Sins?
<name="cersei"> The Targaryens Wed brother and sister for hundreds of years, I know Thats what Jaime and I would say to each other in our moments of doubt Its what I told Ned Stark when he was stupid enough to confront me Half the Targaryens went mad, didnt they? Whats the saying? Every time a Targaryen is born, the Gods flip a coin
<name="tyrion"> Youve beaten the odds Tommen and Myrcella are good, decent children, both of them
<name="man"> Then why wait?
<name="man"> Were sworn to the king
<name="man"> Theres not a king
<name="man"> Thats treason
<name="man"> So is saving Lannisters, yeah?
<name="man"> Back off, you
<name="man"> No, I wont
<name="brienne"> Your son returns at dawn, my lady?
<name="catelyn"> So they say
<name="brienne"> ingslayer wont last the night The more they drink, the angrier theyll get And when the Karstarks draw their swords Who wants to die defending a Lannister?
<name="catelyn"> Come
<name="catelyn"> I need to be alone with him
<name="guard"> My lady
<name="our orders catelyn"> Your orders, which I just gave you, are to leave me alone with him
<name="jaime"> Come to say goodbye, Lady Stark? I believe its my last night in this world Is that a woman?
<name="catelyn"> Do you hear them out there? They want your head
<name="jaime"> Old Lord Karstark doesnt seem to like me
<name="catelyn"> You strangled his son with your chains
<name="jaime"> Oh Oh Was he the one on guard duty? He was in my way Any knight would have done the same
<name="catelyn"> You are no knight You have forsaken every vow you ever took
<name="jaime"> So many vows They make you swear and swear Defend the king, obey the king, obey your father, protect the innocent, defend the weak But what if your father despises the king? What if the king massacres the innocent? Its too much No matter what you do, youre forsaking one vow or another Where did you find this beast?
<name="catelyn"> She is a truer knight than you will ever be, Kingslayer
<name="jaime"> Kingslayer What a king he was Heres to Aerys Targaryen, the Second of His Name, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, Protector of the Realm, and to the sword I shoved in his back
<name="catelyn"> You are a man without honor
<name="jaime"> Do you know, Ive never been with any woman but Cersei So in my own way, I have more honor than poor old dead Ned What was the name of that bastard he fathered?
<name="catelyn"> Brienne
<name="jaime"> No, that wasnt it Snow, a bastard from the North Now, when When good old Ned came home with some whores baby, did you pretend to love it? No Youre not very good at pretending Youre an honest woman You hated that boy, didnt you? How could you not hate him? The walking, talking reminder that the honorable Lord Eddard Stark fucked another woman
<name="catelyn"> Your sword
<name="theon"> I told you what would happen All of you I told you what would happen if you served me loyally And what would happen if you did not
<name="luwin"> What are you doing? What have you done?
<name="theon"> If there are any who still question whether your new lord means what he says, here is the answer to your question
<name="luwin"> No

EPISODE "BLACKWATER" - 27/05/2012


<name="matthos"> Thats it The tides against us
<name="davos"> Aye, but we have the wind Shell blow us straight to the gates
<name="matthos"> Youre coming home
<name="davos"> Kings Landing hasnt been home for 20 years I spent most of my life dodging the royal fleet And now Im sailing right at them
<name="matthos"> This is the royal fleet And youre not a smuggler anymore, youre the high captain
<name="davos"> Of course, there are several royal fleets at the moment
<name="matthos"> Not after tonight When the sun rises, Stannis will sit on the Iron Throne and you will be his Hand
<name="davos"> Gods be good
<name="matthos"> God Father, there is only one and he watches over us
<name="davos"> But not over them?
<name="matthos"> Over all of us The people of Kings Landing did not choose the false king, Joffrey Baratheon They will be glad to see his head on a spike
<name="davos"> Well, first, we have to put it there
<name="matthos"> Our ships outnumber theirs 10-to-1
<name="davos"> Our army outnumber theirs 5-to-1 Those walls have never been breached, and the men guarding the walls, when they see you, they dont see a liberator, they see a stranger come to set their city on fire
<name="matthos"> I have faith in the Lord of Light I have faith in our cause And I have faith in my captain
<name="shae"> Are you afraid, my lion?
<name="tyrion"> If the city falls, Stannis will burn every Lannister he can find Of course Im afraid
<name="shae"> I wont let them hurt you
<name="tyrion"> Im a Lannister I dont have a choice in all this But its not your war
<name="shae"> It is now
<name="tyrion"> You cant fuck your way out of everything
<name="shae"> I have so far Do you remember what you said when you met me in your tent? That I should make love to you like it was your last day on this earth
<name="pycelle"> As you know, Your Grace, it is not only the sworn duty of a maester to carry out the wishes of the house he serves, but also to offer guidance and counsel in times of war
<name="cersei"> Your words are always wise and measured
<name="pycelle"> If you could If anything, a maesters duties become more urgent in times of war and turmoil I remember back in the days of King
<name="cersei"> You brought me something?
<name="pycelle"> Yes Essence of nightshade is as dangerous as it is efficacious A single drop in a cup of wine suffices to soothe ragged nerves Three drops will bring on a deep and dreamless sleep Ten drops
<name="cersei"> I know what ten drops will bring
<name="pycelle"> Your Grace, if I may ask
<name="cersei"> You may not You must have a lot of work to do Im sure many brave men will need your wisdom soon
<name="pycelle"> Yes A siege is very
<name="ersei"> Be careful on the stairs, Grand Maester There are so many
<name="pycelle"> Your Grace
<name="men"> And so he spoke That Lord of Castamere But now the rains weep oer his halls With no one there to hear Yes, now the rains weep oer his halls And not a soul to hear
<name="bronn"> To the boys
<name="soldier"> Lannisters! Whered you learn the Lannister song?
<name="bronn"> Drunk Lannisters
<name="prostitute"> Youve got a pretty voice
<name="bronn"> Thank you very much
<name="prostitute"> And I like your nose How many times you break it?
<name="bronn"> Well, now lets see First time, I was five My mam smacked me with an iron poker
<name="prostitute"> Oh
<name="bronn"> It wasnt me she was aiming at She was trying for my little brother Now he was a real pest
<name="bronn"> Second time, I was nine Got in a scrap with a few older boys They won
<name="third time bronn"> Eh, you dont want to know about the third time
<name="prostitute"> Poor nose
<name="bronn"> Dont feel sorry for him Hell be halfway up your arse before the nights through
<name="bronn"> Welcome, friends This rounds on me
<name="bronn"> I dont think he likes me
<name="sandor"> You think youre a hard man?
<name="bronn"> I know it
<name="bronn"> Its warm in here Weve got beautiful women and good brown ale Plenty for everyone And all you want is to put one of us in the cold ground with no women to keep us company
<name="sandor"> Oh, theres women in the ground I put some there myself So have you You like fucking and drinking and singing But killing, killings the thing you love Youre just like me
<name="sandor"> Only smaller
<name="bronn"> And quicker Eh?
<name="sandor"> Your Lord Imps going to miss you
<name="bronn"> Aye I expect he will someday
<name="man"> Here we are
<name="bronn"> One more drink before the war? Shall we?
<name="int"> TYRIONS CHAMBERs
<name="varys"> Ive always hated the bells They ring for horror A dead king, a city under siege
<name="tyrion"> A wedding
<name="varys"> Exactly Podrick, is that it?
<name="tyrion"> Is that it? Nice touch As if you dont know the name of every boy in town
<name="varys"> Im not entirely sure what youre suggesting
<name="tyrion"> Im entirely sure youre entirely sure what Im suggesting
<name="varys"> Do you trust him?
<name="tyrion"> Oddly enough, I do
<name="varys"> Good
<name="varys"> The map you asked for
<name="tyrion"> There must be 20 miles of tunnels beneath the city
<name="varys"> Closer to 50 The Targaryens built this city to withstand a siege and to provide escape if necessary
<name="tyrion"> Im not escaping Strange as it sounds, Im the captain of the ship, and if the ship goes down, I go with her
<name="varys"> That is good to hear Though Im sure many captains say the same while their ship is afloat You look well suited for battle, my lord
<name="tyrion"> Well, Im not
<name="varys"> For all our sakes, I hope you are wrong My little birds tell me that Stannis Baratheon has taken up with a red priestess from Asshai
<name="tyrion"> What of it?
<name="varys"> You dont believe in the old powers, my lord?
<name="tyrion"> Blood spells, curses, shape-shifting What do you think?
<name="varys"> I think you believe in what you see and in what those you trust have seen You probably dont entirely trust me
<name="tyrion"> Mmm, dont take it personally I dont entirely trust myself
<name="varys"> And yet I have seen things and heard things, things you have not, things I wish I had not I dont believe Ive ever told you how I was cut
<name="tyrion"> No, I dont believe you have
<name="varys"> One day, I will The dark arts have provided Lord Stannis with his armies and paved his path to our door For a man in service to such powers to sit on the Iron Throne, I can think of nothing worse And tonight, I believe you are the only man who can stop him
<name="matthos"> Theyre welcoming the new king
<name="davos"> Ive never known bells to mean surrender They want to play music with us? Lets play Drums
<name="matthos"> Drums
<name="tyrion"> Remember, wait till the ships
<name="bronn"> The ships are in the bay
<name="tyrion"> They must be far enough in
<name="bronn"> I know what in means Do you know how to use that?
<name="tyrion"> I chopped wood once No, I watched my brother chopping wood
<name="bronn"> I saw you kill a man with a shield Youll be unstoppable with an ax
<name="bronn"> Dont get killed
<name="tyrion"> Nor you, my friend
<name="bronn"> Oh, are we friends now?
<name="tyrion"> Of course we are Just because I pay you for your services doesnt diminish our friendship
<name="bronn"> Enhances it, really
<name="tyrion"> Oh! Enhances Fancy word for a sellsword
<name="bronn"> Been spending time with fancy folks
<name="tyrion"> Lady Sansa and Sheila
<name="shae"> Shae
<name="tyrion"> Shae, yes Surely my sister has asked you to join the other highborn ladies in Maegors holdfast
<name="sansa"> She has, my lord, but King Joffrey sent for me to see him off
<name="joffrey"> Sansa
<name="tyrion"> Always been a great romantic, my nephew
<name="joffrey"> Sansa, come here
<name="sansa"> I will pray for your safe return, my lord
<name="tyrion"> Will you?
<name="sansa"> Just as I pray for the kings
<name="tyrion"> Stay safe, my lady
<name="shae"> And you, my lion
<name="joffrey"> Your king rides forth to battle You should see him off with a kiss
<name="joffrey"> My new blade Hearteater, Ive named it Kiss it
<name="joffrey"> Youll kiss it again when I return and taste my uncles blood
<name="sansa"> Will you slay him yourself?
<name="joffrey"> If Stannis is fool enough to come near me
<name="sansa"> So youll be outside the gates fighting in the vanguard?
<name="joffrey"> A king doesnt discuss battle plans with stupid girls
<name="sansa"> Im sorry, Your Grace Youre right, Im stupid Of course youll be in the vanguard They say my brother Robb always goes where the fighting is thickest And he is only a pretender
<name="joffrey"> Your brothers turn will come Then you can lick his blood off Hearteater, too
<name="shae"> Some of those boys will never come back
<name="sansa"> Joffrey will The worst ones always live
<name="shae"> Shh Come, my lady
<name="lancel"> Wheres our fleet?
<name="tyrion"> On the way
<name="joffrey"> Why isnt it here now? Theyre coming
<name="joffrey"> Hound, tell the Hand that his king has asked him a question
<name="sandor"> The king has asked you a question
<name="tyrion"> Ser Lancel, tell the Hound to tell the king that the Hand is extremely busy
<name="lancel"> The Hand of the King would like me to tell you to tell the king
<name="joffrey"> If I tell the Hound to cut you in half, hell do it without a second thought
<name="tyrion"> That would make me the quarterman It just doesnt have the same ring to it Cut me in half and I wont be able to give the signal No signal, no plan No plan and Stannis Baratheon sacks this city, takes the Iron Throne, puts your pinched little head atop a gate somewhere It might be quite amusing, except that my head would be up there, too Ive never much liked my head, but I dont want to see it removed just yet
<name="davos"> Where are their ships?
<name="matthos"> It was wise to attack at night We took them by surprise
<name="davos"> Lord Varys knows what you had for breakfast three days ago There are no surprises here
<name="matthos"> If its true there is dissension in their ranks, maybe their sailors have mutinied
<name="davos"> Maybe
<name="sansa"> I dont know why she wants me here Shes always saying how stupid I am She hates me
<name="shae"> Maybe she hates you less than she hates everyone else
<name="sansa"> I doubt it
<name="shae"> Maybe shes jealous of you
<name="sansa"> Why would she be jealous?
<name="cersei"> Sansa
<name="cersei"> I was wondering where our little dove had flown You look pale, child Is your red flower still blooming?
<name="sansa"> Yes
<name="cersei"> Fitting, isnt it? The men will bleed out there and you will bleed in here Pour Lady Sansa some wine

<name="cersei"> So? I didnt offer you water Whats he doing here?
<name="cersei"> Ser llyn? Hes here to defend us When the axes smash down those doors, you may be glad to have him
<name="sansa"> But we have guards to defend us
<name="cersei"> Guards we have paid Should the city fall, theyll be the first ones out of the doors
<name="gold cloack"> The lads caught a groom and two maids trying to sneak away with a stolen horse and some gold cups
<name="cersei"> The battles first traitors Have Ser llyn see to them Put their heads on spikes outside the stables as a warning
<name="cersei"> The only way to keep the small folk loyal is to make certain they fear you more than they do the enemy Remember that if you ever hope to become a queen
<name="sansa"> You said he was here to protect us
<name="cersei"> He is Traitors are a danger to us all More wine
<name="joffrey"> There they are
<name="tyrion"> Archers to their marks

<name="soldier"> Nock arrows
<name="tyrion"> Hold fast

<name="tyrion"> Hold fast
<name="soldier"> Boulders ready
<name="soldier"> Hold fast
<name="joffrey"> Theres only one ship Where are the rest of them? Where are the rest of them?

<name="man"> More rocks coming up
<name="man"> Hold
<name="davos"> Wildfire Steer clear! Steer clear! The flaming arrow soars ove s boat and hits the wildfire in the water, which erupts in green flame The flames crawl towards the ghost ship
<name="davos"> Matthos! Get down! The explosion engulfs the fleet Meet scream in agony, devoured in green flame, some jumping overboard The immensity of the explosion is stunning Chaos ensues on board as the ships collapse
<name="stannis"> Prepare to land
<name="soldier"> Your Grace
<name="stannis"> The dwarf has played his little trick
<name="soldier"> The wildfire
<name="stannis"> He can only play it once
<name="soldier"> Were too far from the gates The fire, their archers Hundreds will die
<name="stannis"> Thousands
<name="stannis"> Come with me and take this city
<name="cersei"> Sansa, come here, little dove
<name="sansa"> My queen What are you doing? Praying
<name="cersei"> Youre perfect, arent you?
<name="sansa"> Praying
<name="cersei"> What are you praying for?
<name="sansa"> For the gods to have mercy on us all
<name="cersei"> Oh On all of us?
<name="sansa"> Yes, Your Grace
<name="cersei"> Even me?
<name="sansa"> Of course, Your Grace
<name="cersei"> Even Joffrey?
<name="sansa"> Joffrey is my
<name="cersei"> Oh, shut up, you little fool Praying to the gods to have mercy on us all The gods have no mercy Thats why theyre gods My father told me that when he caught me praying My mother had just died, you see I didnt really understand the concept of death, the finality of it I thought that if I prayed very, very hard, the gods would return my mother to me I was four
<name="sansa"> Your father doesnt believe in the gods?
<name="cersei"> He believes in them, he just doesnt like them very much
<name="cersei"> One for her
<name="cersei"> Here Sit Drink
<name="cersei"> Not like that Drink, girl
<name="cersei"> I should have been born a man Id rather face a thousand swords than be shut up inside with this flock of frightened hens
<name="sansa"> They are your guests under your protection You asked them here
<name="cersei"> It was expected of me, as it will be of you if you ever become Joffreys queen If my wretched brother should somehow prevail, these hens will return to their cocks and crow of how my courage inspired them, lifted their spirits
<name="sansa"> And if the city should fall?
<name="cersei"> Youd like that, wouldnt you? The Red Keep should hold for a time, long enough for me to go to the walls and yield to Lord Stannis in person If it were anyone else outside those gates, I might have hoped for a private audience, but this is Stannis Baratheon Id have a better chance of seducing his horse
<name="cersei"> Have I shocked you, little dove? Tears arent a womans only weapon The best ones between your legs Learn how to use it Drink
<name="cersei"> Do you have any notion of what happens when a city is sacked? No, you wouldnt, would you? If the city falls, these fine women should be in for a bit of a rape Half of them will have bastards in their bellies come the morning Youll be glad of your red flower then When a mans blood is up, anything with tits looks good A precious thing like you will look very, very good A slice of cake just waiting to be eaten
<name="man"> More pressure! Pull! Pull! Thats it, men! Pull! Pull
<name="tyrion"> Hes a serious man, Stannis Baratheon
<name="joffrey"> Theyre coming Theyre coming ashore
<name="tyrion"> Rain fire on them

<name="tyrion"> Hound, form a welcome party for any Baratheon troop that manages to touch solid ground Pod, run to the Kings Gate Bring any men guarding it here, now
<name="podrick"> Yes, my lord

<name="sandor"> Any man dies with a clean sword, Ill rape his fucking corpse He and LANCEL engage with the sieging forces They each cut down a number of Baratheon men before LANCEL is struck in the chest by an arrow He stumbles and screams Panting, he retreats
<name="cersel"> When we were young, Jaime and I, we looked so much alike even our father couldnt tell us apart I could never understand why they treated us differently Jaime was taught to fight with sword and lance and mace, and I was taught to smile and sing and please He was heir to Casterly Rock, and I was sold to some stranger like a horse to be ridden whenever he desired
<name="sansa"> You were Roberts queen
<name="cersei"> And you will be Joffreys Enjoy I dont think I know this one

<name="robb"> I have no hatred for the lad
<name="talisa"> That should help his foot grow back
<name="robb"> Youd have us surrender, end all this bloodshed I understand The country would be at peace and life would be just under the righteous hand of good King Joffrey

<name="joffrey"> You cant talk to me like that The king can do as he likes
<name="tyrion"> The Mad King did as he liked Has your Uncle Jaime ever told you what happened to him?
<name="meryn"> No one threatens His Grace in the presence of the Kingsguard
<name="tyrion"> Im not threatening the king, ser I am educating my nephew Bronn, the next time Ser Meryn speaks, kill him That was a threat See the difference?
<name="tyrion"> I apologize for my nephews behavior Tell me the truth Do you want an end to this engagement?

<name="ros"> Hmm
<name="joffrey"> Use this
<name="joffrey"> Harder
<name="joffrey"> I said harder Hed want me to get his moneys worth
<name="ros"> Your Grace, too much pain will spoil the pleasure
<name="daisy"> Please, Your Grace
<name="ros"> Your Grace, if your uncle finds out
<name="joffrey"> Oh, I want him to find out You will bring her to his chambers when youre finished and show him what youve done, or the same thing will happen to you
<name="joffrey"> Begin
<name="joffrey"> Harder
<name="renly"> Well, if it isnt my favorite whoremonger Pray I havent kept you waiting long
<name="littlefinger"> Your Grace
<name="renly"> Now you do the Lannisters bidding, is that it? Tell me, was my brothers body even cold before you secured your newest patron?
<name="littlefinger"> Im a practical man
<name="renly"> Just not a loyal one
<name="littlefinger"> And who would you have me be loyal to? Your brothers corpse?
<name="renly"> I dont like you, Lord Baelish I dont like your face I dont like the words that come oozing out of your mouth I dont want you in my tent one minute more than necessary So tell me, why are you here?
<name="renly"> You can trust Brienne Her loyalty comes without charge
<name="littlefinger"> You still have many friends at court, Your Grace, many who believe Ned Stark erred by not supporting your claim
<name="renly"> Now I understand You know I have the numbers You know Im marching on Kings Landing When I take the throne, you hope to retain your position And your head
<name="littlefinger"> I would give priority to my head
<name="littlefinger"> I understand that you dont like me, and while that saddens me greatly, I did not come here today seeking your affection When you march on Kings Landing, you may find yourself facing a protracted siege or open gates
<name="littlefinger"> Your Grace
<name="margaery"> Lord Baelish
<name="littlefinger"> All of these tents look the same to me -Would you be so kind
<name="margaery"> It would be my pleasure It took me weeks to learn my way around the camp Twice I walked in on officers in stages of undress And the moment I learn which tent is mine, were on the move again
<name="littlefinger"> Your tent ? Not Our tent ? The king snores, perhaps? Or simply prefers solitude? Pressures of command, no doubt Four kings vying for the throne
<name="margaery"> I am not tutored in warfare, but basic arithmetic favors the side with the greater numbers
<name="littlefinger"> If war were arithmetic, the mathematicians would rule the world I did notice your brother entering His Graces tent just now
<name="margaery"> The place of a Kingsguard is by the kings side
<name="littlefinger"> And on the night of your wedding, who was by the kings side then?
<name="margaery"> You seem quite interested in our marriage
<name="littlefinger"> Your marriage is quite interesting Not only to me, but to the realm The marriage of a wealthy girl always breeds interest, if nothing else
<name="margaery"> Youve never married, have you?
<name="littlefinger"> Ive been unlucky in my affections, sadly
<name="margaery"> That is sad Though perhaps its for the best The whole notion of marriage seems to confuse you, so allow me to explain My husband is my king, and my king is my husband Here is your tent, Lord Baelish Good night
<name="daenerys"> This isnt your horse
<name="kovarro"> It was given to me by the Thirteen The Elders of Qarth
<name="daenerys"> Qarth?
<name="kovarro"> Three days to the east, on the sea
<name="daenerys"> Will they let us in?
<name="kovarro"> They said they would be honored to receive the Mother of Dragons
<name="daenerys"> What do you know of this place?
<name="jorah"> Only that the desert around their walls is called the Garden of Bones Every time the Qartheen shut their gates on a traveler, the garden grows
<name="man"> Go on
<name="man"> You, keep moving
<name="man"> Bring her about
<name="hot pie"> What kind of fire melts stone?
<name="arya"> Dragon fire
<name="hot pie"> Theres dragons here?
<name="gendry"> No, all the dragons are dead
<name="hot pie"> Whats that smell?
<name="arya"> Dead people
<name="soldier"> Move
<name="man"> Please, please, no, no! No
<name="woman"> Hes dead He was my son My sister was three days ago My husband, the day before that
<name="gendry"> They take someone every day?
<name="arya"> Does anyone live?
<name="arya"> Joffrey Cersei llyn Payne The Hound Joffrey Cersei llyn Payne The Hound Joffrey Cersei llyn Payne The Hound
<name="catelyn"> How dare you?
<name="littlefinger"> You may have heard false reports
<name="catelyn"> You betrayed Ned

<name="stannis"> Lady Stark, I had not thought to find you in the Stormlands
<name="catelyn"> I had not thought to be here, Lord Stannis
<name="renly"> Can that truly be you?
<name="stannis"> Who else might it be?
<name="renly"> When I saw your standard, I couldnt be sure Whose banner is that?
<name="stannis"> My own
<name="renly"> I suppose if we used the same one, the battle would be terribly confusing Why is your stag on fire?
<name="melisandre"> The king has taken for his sigil the fiery heart of the Lord of Light
<name="renly"> Ah, you must be this fire priestess we hear so much about Mmm, brother, now I understand why you found religion in your old age
<name="stannis"> Watch yourself, Renly
<name="renly"> No, no, Im relieved I never really believed you were a fanatic Charmless, rigid, a bore, yes, but not a godly man
<name="melisandre"> You should kneel before your brother Hes the Lords chosen, born amidst salt and smoke
<name="renly"> Born amidst salt and smoke? Is he a ham?
<name="stannis"> Thats twice Ive warned you
<name="catelyn"> Listen to yourselves If you were sons of mine, I would knock your heads together and lock you in a bedchamber until you remembered that you were brothers
<name="stannis"> It is strange to find you beside my brother, Lady Stark Your husband was a supporter of my claim Lord Eddards integrity cost him his head And you sit beside this pretender and chastise me
<name="catelyn"> We share a common enemy
<name="stannis"> The Iron Throne is mine by right All those that deny that are my foes
<name="renly"> The whole realm denies it, from Dorne to the Wall Old men deny it with their death rattle and unborn children deny it in their mothers wombs No one wants you for their king You never wanted any friends, brother But a man without friends is a man without power
<name="stannis"> For the sake of the mother who bore us, I will give you this one night to reconsider Strike your banners, come to me before dawn, and I will grant you your old seat in the Council Ill even name you my heir until a son is born to me Otherwise I shall destroy you
<name="renly"> Look across those fields, brother Can you see all those banners?
<name="stannis"> You think a few bolts of cloth will make you king?
<name="renly"> No The men holding those bolts of cloth will make me king
<name="stannis"> We shall see, Renly Come the dawn, we shall see
<name="melisandre"> Look to your sins, Lord Renly The night is dark and full of terrors
<name="renly"> Would you believe I loved him once?
<name="daenerys"> I thought we were welcome
<name="jorah"> If you heard a Dothraki horde was approaching your city, you might do the same, Khaleesi
<name="daenerys"> Horde?
<name="daenerys"> My name is Daenerys SPICE
<name="king"> Daenerys Stormborn of the house Targaryen
<name="daenerys"> You know me, my lord?
<name="spice king"> Only by reputation, Khaleesi And Im no lord, merely a humble merchant They call you the Mother of Dragons
<name="daenerys"> And what should I call you?
<name="spice king"> Oh, my name is quite long and quite impossible for foreigners to pronounce I am simply a trader of spices But we are the Thirteen, charged with the governance and protection of Qarth, the greatest city that ever was or will be
<name="daenerys"> The beauty of Quarth is legendary SPICE KING Qarth
<name="daenerys"> Qarth
<name="spice king"> Might we see the dragons?
<name="daenerys"> My friend, we have traveled very far We have no food, no water Once I see my people fed, I would be honored SPICE
<name="king"> Forgive me, Mother of Dragons, but no man alive has seen a living dragon Some of my more skeptical friends refuse to believe your children even exist All we ask is the chance to see for ourselves
<name="daenerys"> I am not a liar
<name="spice king"> Oh, I dont think you are But as Ive never met you before, my opinion on the matter is of limited value
<name="daenerys"> Where I come from, guests are treated with respect, not insulted at the gates
<name="spice king"> Then perhaps you should return to where you come from We wish you well
<name="daenerys"> What are you doing? You promised to receive me
<name="spice king"> We have received you Here we are, and here you are
<name="daenerys"> If you do not let us in, all of us will die
<name="spice king"> Which we shall deeply regret But Qarth did not become the greatest city that ever was or will be by letting Dothraki savages through its gates
<name="jorah"> Khaleesi, please be careful
<name="daenerys"> Thirteen! When my dragons are grown, we will take back what was stolen from me and destroy those who have wronged me We will lay waste to armies and burn cities to the ground Turn us away and we will burn you first
<name="spice king"> Ah You are a true Targaryen Only, as you said a moment ago, if we dont let you into the city, you will all die
<name="and so xaro"> Retreating in fear from a little girl is unbecoming of the greatest city that ever was or will be
<name="spice king"> The discussion is over, Xaro Xhoan Daxos The Thirteen have spoken
<name="xaro"> I am one of the Thirteen, and I am still speaking
<name="spice king"> The girl threatens to burn our city to the ground and you would invite her in for a cup of wine? She is the Mother of Dragons
<name="xaro"> Do you expect her to watch her people starve without breathing fire? I believe we can allow a few Dothraki through our gates without dooming our city After all, here I am, a savage from the Summer Isles, and Qarth still SPICE
<name="king"> Our decision is final
<name="xaro"> Very well I invoke soumai
<name="xaro"> I will vouch for her, her people, and her dragons, in accordance with the law
<name="spice king"> Be it on your head
<name="xaro"> Welcome to Qarth, my lady
<name="mountain"> You
<name="tickler"> Is there gold or silver in the village?
<name="gendry"> Im not from the village
<name="tickler"> Where is the Brotherhood?
<name="gendry"> I dont know what that is
<name="man"> You two Take Lord Lannisters things to his quarters
<name="tywin"> Whats this?
<name="mountain"> We werent expecting you till tomorrow, Lord Tywin
<name="tywin"> Evidently not Why are these prisoners not in their cells?
<name="mountain"> Cells are overflowing, my lord
<name="polliver"> This lot wont be here long Dont need no permanent place After we interrogate em
<name="tywin"> Are we so well-manned that we can afford to discard able young bodies and skilled laborers?
<name="tywin"> You, do you have a trade?
<name="gendry"> Smith, my lord
<name="polliver"> What are you looking at? Kneel! Kneel or Ill carve your lungs out, boy
<name="tywin"> Hell do no such thing This ones a girl, you idiot, dressed as a boy Why?
<name="arya"> Safer to travel, my lord
<name="tywin"> Smart More than I can say for this lot Get these prisoners to work Bring the girl I need a new cupbearer
<name="mountain"> My lord
<name="tyrion"> Your visits are too few, cousin
<name="lancel"> Her Grace, the Queen Regent, commands you to release Grand Maester Pycelle Heres your warrant
<name="tyrion"> So it is Will you take a cup with me? I find that mulled wine helps me sleep
<name="lancel"> I am here at Her Graces behest, not to drink with you, Imp
<name="tyrion"> If my sister was so concerned for Pycelle, I would have thought shed come herself Instead she sends you What am I to make of that?
<name="lancel"> I dont care what you make of it, so long as you release your prisoner immediately
<name="tyrion"> And youve received these instructions directly from Cersei?
<name="lancel"> As I said several times
<name="tyrion"> And youve waited this long to deliver the information?
<name="lancel"> When the Queen Regent gives me a command, I carry it out without delay
<name="tyrion"> Cersei must have great trust in you, allowing you into her chamber during the hour of the wolf
<name="lancel"> The Queen Regent has a great many responsibilities She often works from dusk till dawn
<name="tyrion"> She must be very glad to have you helping her from dusk till dawn
<name="tyrion"> Ah Lavender oil She always loved lavender oil, even as a girl
<name="lancel"> I am a knight
<name="tyrion"> An anointed knight, yes Tell me, did Cersei have you knighted before or after she took you into her bed? What? Nothing to say? No more warnings for me, ser?
<name="lancel"> You will withdraw these filthy accusations
<name="tyrion"> Have you ever given any thought to what King Joffrey will have to say when he finds out youve been bedding his mother?
<name="lancel"> Its not my fault
<name="tyrion"> Did she take you against your will? Can you not defend yourself, knight?
<name="lancel"> Your own father, Lord Tywin, when I was named the Kings squire, he told me to obey her in everything
<name="tyrion"> Did he tell you to fuck her, too?
<name="lancel"> I only meant I did as I was bid
<name="tyrion"> Hated every moment of it, is that what youll have me believe? A high place in court, a knighthood, my sisters legs spreading open for you at night Oh, yes, it must have been terrible Wait here His Grace will want to hear this
<name="lancel"> Mercy! Mercy, my lord! I beg you
<name="tyrion"> Save it for Joffrey He loves a good grovel
<name="lancel"> My lord, it was your sisters bidding, the Queen Ill leave the city at once, I swear
<name="tyrion"> No, I think not
<name="lancel"> My lord?
<name="tyrion"> You heard me My father told you to obey my sister Obey her Stay close to her side Keep her trust Pleasure her whenever she requires No one ever need know, as long as you keep faith with me I want to know what Cersei is doing, where she goes, who she sees, what they talk of, everything And you will tell me
<name="lancel"> Yes, my lord, I will I swear it, as you command
<name="tyrion"> Oh, rise, rise Let us drink to our understanding Oh, you dont have a cup Oh, well Smile, cousin My sister is a beautiful woman, and its all for the good of the realm Go back and tell her that I beg her forgiveness, that I want no more conflict between us and that, henceforth, I shall do nothing without her consent
<name="lancel"> But her demands?
<name="tyrion"> Oh, Ill give her Pycelle
<name="lancel"> You will?
<name="tyrion"> Yes, Ill release him in the morning Cersei can keep him as a pet, if she wants, but I will not have him on the Council I could swear that I had not harmed a single hair on his head, but that would not, strictly speaking, be true Stay within one table length
<name="davos"> Your Grace
<name="stannis"> Do your knucklebones bring you luck?
<name="davos"> Well, lifes been good since you hacked them off, Your Grace And its four less fingernails to clean
<name="stannis"> Fewer
<name="davos"> Pardon?
<name="stannis"> Four fewer fingernails to clean Never understood why you had to wear them
<name="davos"> It reminds me of where I come from and where I am now It reminds me of your justice It was an honest punishment and you were good with the cleaver
<name="stannis"> You were a hero and a smuggler A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad the good
<name="davos"> A lesson Ive tried to teach my son
<name="stannis"> Does he listen?
<name="davos"> To me? Gods, no But if your red woman told him to leap from the crows nest
<name="stannis"> She has a name I trust youve not forgotten your smugglers tricks
<name="davos"> Ive lived within the law for 17
<name="stannis"> I want you to be a smuggler this time
<name="davos"> Any shore, any night What am I bringing ashore?
<name="stannis"> The red woman No one must know what you do and well not speak of this again
<name="davos"> I am true to Your Grace and always will be, but surely there are other ways, cleaner ways
<name="stannis"> Cleaner ways dont win wars
<name="melisandre"> Are you afraid, Onion Knight?
<name="davos"> Someone once told me the night is dark and full of terrors
<name="melisandre"> Youve carried more unpleasant cargo in your time Are you a good man, Ser Davos Seaworth?
<name="davos"> Id say my parts are mixed, my lady, good and bad
<name="melisandre"> If half an onion is black with rot, its a rotten onion A man is good or he is evil
<name="davos"> And which are you?
<name="melisandre"> Oh, good Im a knight myself, of sorts, a champion of light and life
<name="davos"> Well, that must be very nice for you
<name="melisandre"> Do you love your wife?
<name="davos"> I do
<name="melisandre"> Yet you have known other women
<name="davos"> Dont talk about my wife
<name="melisandre"> Im not Im talking about other women Like me, Ser Davos You want me You want to see whats beneath this robe
<name="melisandre"> And you will
<name="davos"> Strange that this Lord of Light asks you to work in the shadows
<name="melisandre"> Shadows cannot live in the dark, Ser Davos They are servants of light, the children of fire And the brighter the flame, the darker they are
<name="davos"> These werent here before Theyve barred the passage
<name="melisandre"> They cant bar our passage
<name="davos"> Gods protect us

<name="renly"> Then I see no reason for hostility between us Your soncan go on calling himself King in the North The Starks will have dominion over all lands north of Moat Cailin, provided he swears me an oath of fealty
<name="catelyn"> And the wording of this oath?
<name="renly"> The same Ned Stark swore to Robert 18 years ago Cat, their friendship held the kingdoms together
<name="catelyn"> And in return for my sons loyalty?
<name="renly"> In the morning, Ill destroy my brothers army
<name="renly"> When thats done, Baratheon and Stark will fight their common enemy together, as they have done many times before
<name="catelyn"> Our two houses have always been close, which is why I am begging you to reconsider this battle Negotiate a peace with your brother
<name="renly"> Negotiate with Stannis? You heard him out there Id have better luck debating the wind
<name="renly"> Please bring my terms to your son I believe we are natural allies I hope he feels the same Together we could end this war in a fortnight
<name="brienne"> No! No
<name="soldier"> Follow me
<name="soldier"> Youll die for this
<name="catelyn"> No, wait, it wasnt her
<name="catelyn"> Weve got to leave Theyll hang you for this
<name="man"> Inside the kings tent
<name="go man"> Now
<name="brienne"> I wont leave him
<name="catelyn"> You cant avenge him if youre dead
<name="man"> Over there, go
<name="brienne"> Not that way
<name="margaery"> We need to go home Loras
<name="littlefinger"> My lord, my lady
<name="loras"> Get out
<name="littlefinger"> Stannis will be here in an hour When he arrives, Renlys bannermen will flock to him Your former companions will fight for the privilege of selling you to their new king
<name="loras"> And you want that privilege for yourself
<name="littlefinger"> You will note that I am standing here talking to you, not Stannis
<name="margaery"> Theres no time for this
<name="loras"> Ride back to Highgarden, sister Im not running from Stannis
<name="margaery"> Brienne of Tarth murdered Renly
<name="loras"> I dont believe that You dont believe that Who gained the most from our kings death?
<name="littlefinger"> Stannis
<name="loras"> I will put a sword through his righteous face
<name="margaery"> You cant stay here
<name="loras"> He would have been a true king, a good king
<name="littlefinger"> Tell me, Ser Loras, what do you desire most in this world?
<name="loras"> Revenge
<name="littlefinger"> I have always found that to be the purest of motivations, but you wont have a chance to put your sword through Stannis, not today Youll be cut to pieces before he sets foot on solid ground If it is justice that you want, be smart about it
<name="margaery"> You cant avenge him from the grave Bring the horses Please
<name="margaery"> He was very handsome
<name="littlefinger"> He was, Your Grace
<name="margaery"> Your Grace Calling yourself king doesnt make you one And if Renly wasnt a king, I wasnt a queen
<name="littlefinger"> Do you want to be a queen?
<name="margaery"> No I want to be the queen
<name="cersei"> Killed? By whom?
<name="tyrion"> Accounts differ Most seem to implicate Catelyn Stark in some way
<name="cersei"> Really? Whod have thought?
<name="tyrion"> Some say it was one of his own Kingsguard, while still others say it was Stannis himself who did it after negotiations went sour
<name="cersei"> Whomever did it, I say well done
<name="tyrion"> Its not what Varys says He says Renlys army is flocking to support Stannis, which would give Stannis superiority over us on both land and sea
<name="cersei"> Littlefinger says we can outspend him three to one
<name="tyrion"> And I say Father raised you to have too much respect for money Stannis Baratheon is coming for us, sooner rather than later
<name="cersei"> Arent there other things you should be doing, like sealing my daughter in a crate so you can ship her away?
<name="tyrion"> Shell be safer in Dorne
<name="cersei"> Yes, I know how concerned you are for her safety
<name="tyrion"> It so happens that I am Myrcella is a sweet, innocent girl and I dont blame her at all for you
<name="cersei"> So clever Arent you always so clever with your schemes and your plots?
<name="tyrion"> Schemes and plots are the same thing They are going to attack us We need to be ready
<name="cersei"> No need to concern yourself over it The king is taking personal charge of siege preparations
<name="tyrion"> May I ask specifically what the king has in mind?
<name="cersei"> You may, specifically, or you may ask vaguely The answer will be the same
<name="tyrion"> Its important that we talk about this
<name="cersei"> Its the kings royal prerogative to withhold sensitive information from his councilors
<name="lancel"> Its wildfire
<name="tyrion"> Wildfire? You wouldnt lie to me, would you, cousin?
<name="lancel"> No
<name="tyrion"> Thats a lie right there
<name="lancel"> It is not a lie Why would I lie?
<name="tyrion"> Tell me, if the vile allegations against my brother and sister are true, do you think it will make Jaime more likely to kill you or less likely? When I tell him youre fucking her, I mean
<name="lancel"> Im telling you the truth
<name="tyrion"> The smart money would be on more likely
<name="lancel"> Shes making wildfire
<name="tyrion"> But then perhaps his own unnatural urges will give him sympathy for yours
<name="lancel"> The Alchemists Guild is being commissioned
<name="tyrion"> I suppose theres only one way to find out
<name="lancel"> They have thousands of pots already stored in their vaults They are planning to launch it from the city walls into Stannis ships and armies Please
<name="tyrion"> When did she tell you this?
<name="lancel"> I heard her talking with the pyromancer And the other night, after I left her, she went to meet him I swear to you
<name="tyrion"> Swear to me on what?
<name="lancel"> On my life
<name="tyrion"> But I dont care about your life
<name="lancel"> In the light of the Seven, by all that is holy and right, I, Lancel Lannister, do solemnly vow
<name="tyrion"> All right, all right Enough Even torturing you is boring Just get out
<name="tyrion"> Oh, Lancel, tell my friend Bronn to please kill you if anything should happen to me
<name="lancel"> Please kill me if anything should happen to Lord Tyrion
<name="bronn"> It will be my pleasure
<name="davos"> Your Grace
<name="stannis"> What is it?
<name="davos"> Im sorry about your brother, Your Grace, I wanted to let you know that people grieve for him
<name="stannis"> Fools love a fool I grieve for him as well, for the boy he was, not the man he grew to be
<name="davos"> I need to speak to you about what I saw in that cave
<name="stannis"> I thought I made it clear to you thered be no need to speak to me on this matter
<name="davos"> Your Grace, I -
<name="stannis"> Ive never known you to need to hear a thing twice
<name="davos"> And Ive never known you to hide from the truth
<name="stannis"> Youve come to lecture me on truth?
<name="davos"> Ive come to tell you that what I saw
<name="stannis"> All my brothers bannermen have come to my side Except the Tyrells, who fled like cowards They wont be able to resist us now Soon I shall be sitting on the Iron Throne
<name="davos"> Nothing is worth what this will cost you, not even the Iron
<name="stannis"> Ill hear no more about it
<name="man"> Take a company of men, secure the perimeter
<name="davos"> When do we sail for Kings Landing?
<name="stannis"> As soon as Ive consolidated my troops Well make short work of the Lannisters fleet Once Blackwater Bay is cleared, well deliver our troops to their doorstep and take the city
<name="davos"> And will you bring Lady Melisandre with you?
<name="stannis"> Thats not your concern
<name="davos"> If you take Kings Landing with her by your side, the victory will be hers
<name="stannis"> I never thought Id have reason to doubt your loyalty Was I wrong?
<name="davos"> Loyal service means telling hard truths
<name="stannis"> Oh, truth again All right, whats the truth? The hard truth?
<name="davos"> Shes a foreigner preaching her foreign religion Some believe she whispers orders in your ear and you obey
<name="stannis"> What do you believe?
<name="davos"> You won those bannermen from Renly Dont lose them to her
<name="stannis"> We set out for Kings Landing without Lady Melisandre And you lead the fleet into Blackwater Bay
<name="davos"> Your Grace, Im honored, but my time on the sea was spent evading ships, not attacking them The other lords wont be happy
<name="stannis"> Most of those lords should consider themselves lucky I dont hang them for treason Hard truths cut both ways, Ser Davos
<name="girl"> Ive got it! Ive got it
<name="man"> So its that one there at the top, on the right
<name="man"> Buy my fruit, my lord Fresh fruit
<name="tyrion"> Stannis has more infantry, more ships, more horses What do we have?
<name="bronn"> Theres that mind of yours you keep going on about
<name="tyrion"> Well, Ive never actually been able to kill people with it
<name="bronn"> Good thing Id be out of a job What about your father?
<name="tyrion"> He hasnt sent a raven in weeks Hes very busy Being repeatedly humiliated by Robb Stark is time-consuming We wont be able to hold the city against Stannis, not the way Joffreys planning on holding it
<name="protester"> Corruption
<name="crowd"> Yes
<name="protester"> We are swollen, bloated, foul Brother fornicates with sister in the bed of kings and were surprised when the fruit of their incest is rotten? Yes, a rotten king
<name="tyrion"> Its hard to argue with his assessment
<name="bronn"> Not after what he did to your birthday present
<name="tyrion"> The king is a lost cause Its the rest of us Im worried about now
<name="man"> A dancing king, prancing down his bloodstained halls to the tune of a twisted demon monkey
<name="tyrion"> You have to admire his imagination
<name="bronn"> Hes talking about you
<name="tyrion"> What? Demon monkey?
<name="bronn"> People think youre pulling the kings strings They blame you for the citys ills
<name="tyrion"> Blame me? Im trying to save them
<name="bronn"> You dont need to convince me
<name="tyrion"> Demon monkey
<name="man"> Yeah, come on
<name="theon"> Youre the crew of the Sea Bitch? Im your commander Welcome
<name="theon"> Stop Stop! Your captain commands you to stop

<name="black lorren"> And who decides if weve done our jobs well?
<name="theon"> I do Your captain
<name="black lorren"> I have been reaving and raping since before you left Balons balls, Captain Dont reckon Ive got much use for your ideas on how to do it Dont reckon Ive got much use for a captain at all Im thinking I can do the job of captain real well myself All I need is a ship You wouldnt know where I could find myself a ship now, would you?
<name="theon"> You could do that, take the ship, head out on your own And I will hunt you down, drag you back here in chains and hang you for a traitor
<name="yara"> Stop We yield
<name="yara"> Congratulations on your first command
<name="theon"> Thank you Kind of you to come see me off
<name="yara"> Oh, Im not here for you I was just on my way to Red Harbor Ive got 30 ships Theres nowhere to put them here Too narrow
<name="theon"> Youd better get out there Wouldnt want her to set sail without you
<name="yara"> That would never happen My crew would wait on deck for a year if I asked them to This lot, though Enjoy the Stony Shore
<name="dagmer"> Come on, Ill take you out
<name="theon"> Who are you?
<name="dagmer"> Dagmer, your first mate
<name="theon"> Why arent you with the rest of them? Or did they send you to row me out and dump me halfway in the sea? That would be good for a laugh
<name="dagmer"> Theyre not gonna respect you until you prove yourself
<name="theon"> And how am I supposed to prove myself by pillaging piss-poor fishing villages?
<name="dagmer"> Youre not
<name="theon"> And yet thats the task my father has given me to prove that Im a true Iron Islander
<name="dagmer"> Theyre all Iron Islanders Do they do as theyre told or do they do as they like?
<name="theon"> The Stony Shores not far from Torrhens Square
<name="dagmer"> The seat of the House of Tallhart, a more impressive prize than a few fishermens daughters What, you dont think we could take it?
<name="theon"> No, we could We could never hold it for more than a few days As soon as Winterfell got word that wed taken Torrhens Square, the Starks would send their men to take it back
<name="and then theon"> Take me to my ship
<name="reginald"> The Starks have overextended their lines Now that summers over, theyll have a hard time keeping their men and horses fed
<name="tywin"> The Starks understand winter better than we ever will The cold wont beat them
<name="amory"> Our spies report growing discontent among the Northern lords They want to return home and gather the harvest before the crops turn
<name="tywin"> And Im sure if those same spies snuck into our own encampments, they would report growing discontent amongst the Southern lords This is war, no ones content Weve underestimated the Stark boy for too long He has a good mind for warfare, his men worship him And as long as he keeps winning battles, theyll keep believing he is King in the North Youve been waiting for him to fail He is not going to fail, not without our help So how do we stop him?
<name="reginald"> Weve worked through the night, my lord Perhaps wed profit from some sleep
<name="tywin"> Yes, I think you would, Reginald And because youre my cousin, I might even let you wake from that sleep Go, Im sure your wife must miss you
<name="reginald"> My wifes in Lannisport
<name="tywin"> Well, then youd better start riding Go, before I change my mind and send her your head
<name="tywin"> If your name wasnt Lannister, youd be scrubbing out pots in the cooks tent Go
<name="tywin"> Not wine, water Well be here for some time Girl, where are you from?
<name="arya"> Maidenpool, my lord
<name="tywin"> And who are the Lords of Maidenpool? Remind me
<name="arya"> House Mooton, my lord
<name="tywin"> And what is their sigil?
<name="tywin"> A red salmon I think a Maidenpool girl would remember that Youre a Northerner, arent you?
<name="tywin"> Good One more time, where are you from?
<name="arya"> Barrowton, my lord House Dustin Two crossed longaxes beneath a black crown
<name="tywin"> And what do they say of Robb Stark in the North?
<name="arya"> They call him the Young Wolf
<name="tywin"> And?
<name="arya"> They say he rides into battle on the back of a giant direwolf They say he can turn into a wolf himself when he wants They say he cant be killed
<name="tywin"> And do you believe them?
<name="arya"> No, my lord Anyone can be killed
<name="tywin"> Fetch that water
<name="jaqen"> A girl says nothing
<name="jaqen"> A girl keeps her mouth closed No one hears, and friends may talk in secret, yes? A boy becomes a girl
<name="arya"> I was always a girl
<name="jaqen"> And I was always aware But the girl keeps secrets It is not for a man to spoil them
<name="arya"> Youre one of them now I should have let you burn
<name="jaqen"> And you fetch water for one of them now Why is this right for you and wrong for me?
<name="arya"> I didnt have a choice
<name="jaqen"> You did I did And here we are
<name="jaqen"> A man pays his debts A man owes three
<name="arya"> Three what?
<name="jaqen"> The Red God takes what is his, lovely girl And only death may pay for life You saved me and the two I was with You stole three deaths from the Red God We have to give them back Speak three names and the man will do the rest Three lives I will give you, no more, no less, and were done
<name="arya"> I can name anyone and youll kill him?
<name="jaqen"> A man has said
<name="arya"> The one who tortures everyone
<name="jaqen"> A man needs a name
<name="arya"> I dont know his name They call him the Tickler
<name="jaqen"> That is enough Go now, girl Your master is thirsty
<name="jeor"> Hes not here yet Hed have seen us, blown the horn
<name="jon"> When will he come?
<name="jeor"> The Halfhand does things in his own time
<name="jon"> My uncle told me stories about him
<name="jeor"> Most of them are true
<name="jon"> I heard the Halfhand spent half of last winter beyond the Wall
<name="jeor"> The whole winter He was north of the Skirling Pass when the snows came Had to wait for the thaw
<name="jon"> So it is possible for someone to survive out here on their own
<name="jeor"> Well, possible for the Halfhand
<name="sam"> Beautiful, isnt it? Gilly would love it here
<name="eddison tollett"> Theres nothing more sickening than a man in love
<name="man"> About time you did something At least youll keep warm
<name="sam"> The Fist of the First Men Think of how old this place is Before the Targaryens defeated the Andals, before the Andals took Westeros from the First Men
<name="eddison tollett"> Before I die, please, stop talking
<name="sam"> Thousands and thousands of years ago, the First Men stood here where were standing all through the long night What do you think they were like, the First Men?
<name="eddison tollett"> Stupid Smart people dont find themselves in places like this
<name="jon"> I think they were afraid I think they came here to get away from something And I dont think it worked
<name="grenn"> Wildlings?
<name="jon"> One blast is for rangers returning Wildlings is two blasts
<name="eddison tollett"> So you got to stand there waiting, wondering One blast for friends, two for foes
<name="sam"> And three for White Walkers Its been a thousand years, but thats the only time they blow the horn three times
<name="grenn"> But if its been a thousand years, how do you know?
<name="sam"> Well I read it in a book
<name="eddison tollett"> I read it in a book
<name="jon"> Look Its Qhorin Halfhand
<name="eddison tollett"> Aye, well live another day Hurrah
<name="haylene"> Take care, my lord
<name="tyrion"> I remember reading an old sailors proverb, Piss on wildfire and your cock burns off
<name="haylene"> Oh, I have not conducted this experiment It could well be true The substance burns so hot, it melts wood, stone, even steel, and, of course, flesh The substance burns so hot, it melts flesh like tallow
<name="haylene"> After the dragons died, wildfire was the key to the Targaryen power
<name="tyrion"> My companion takes issue
<name="bronn"> If I could tell you how many crazy old men Ive seen pushing carts around army camps making grand claims about jars full of pig shit No offense meant
<name="haylene"> Our order does not deal in pig shit The substance is fire given form And we have been perfecting it since the days of Maegor
<name="bronn"> To do what?
<name="haylene"> The jars are put in catapults and flung at the enemy
<name="tyrion"> How much do you have?
<name="bronn"> If you could get real soldiers to man the catapults, then maybe youd hit your target one time in ten, but all the real soldiers are in the Riverlands with your father
<name="haylene"> My lord, this man is insulting
<name="bronn"> I dont know if youve ever seen a battle, old man, but things can get a bit messy Cause when were flinging things at Stannis, hes flinging them right back at us Men die, men shit themselves, men run, which means pots falling, which means fire inside the walls, which means the poor cunts trying to defend the city end up burning it down
<name="tyrion"> My friend remains unconvinced
<name="haylene"> He would not dare insult my order whilst Aerys Targaryen lived
<name="bronn"> Well, hes not living anymore And all his pots of wildfire didnt help him, did they? Men win wars, not magic tricks
<name="haylene"> We have been working tirelessly, day and night, ever since your royal sister commanded us to do so Our present count stands at 7,811 Enough to burn Stannis Baratheons fleet and armies both
<name="bronn"> This is a shit idea
<name="tyrion"> Im afraid I have to concur with my advisor, Wisdom Haylene The contents of this room could lay Kings Landing low You wont be making wildfire for my sister any longer Youll be making it for me
<name="daenerys"> Dracarys Dracarys
<name="daenerys"> Hell be able to feed himself from now on
<name="daenerys"> Let him sleep, Doreah
<name="doreah"> Yes, Khaleesi
<name="daenerys"> He loves you
<name="irri"> I rewove this part of the top And I fixed the heel on this one
<name="daenerys"> Thank you, my friend
<name="doreah"> Did you see the dress Xaro had made for you? They say hes the wealthiest man in Qarth
<name="irri"> It is known
<name="doreah"> And if Qarth is the wealthiest city in Essos
<name="daenerys"> The last time a rich man gave me a dress, he was selling me to Khal Drogo
<name="irri"> May he ride forever through the night lands
<name="daenerys"> Xaro is our host, but we know nothing about him Men like to talk about other men when theyre happy
<name="doreah"> You would look like a real princess in Xaros
<name="irri"> Shes not a princess Shes a Khaleesi You should wear it, Khaleesi
<name="irri"> You are their guest It would be rude not to
<name="woman"> And you must visit the night market The Qartheen night market is like no night market youve ever seen
<name="daenerys"> It sounds wonderful
<name="woman"> The Meereenis think they have a night market I will take you there myself
<name="daenerys"> Please excuse me for a moment
<name="daenerys"> What are they doing?
<name="jorah"> Malakko says the statue is too heavy to carry Kovarro says that Malakko is an idiot They can pry out the gems, the rest is pure gold Very soft He can chop off as much as we can carry
<name="kovarro"> Or melt it Very simple
<name="daenerys"> We are his guests! You cant pry it or chop it or melt it
<name="kovarro"> Of course not, Khaleesi! We will wait until we leave
<name="daenerys"> Not even when we leave
<name="kovarro"> Why not?
<name="daenerys"> Our host saved us from the Red Waste and you want to steal from him? I will hear no more
<name="daenerys"> My brother used to say the only thing the Dothraki knew how to do was steal things better men have built
<name="jorah"> Its not the only thing Theyre quite good at killing the better men
<name="daenerys"> Thats not the kind of queen Im going to be
<name="pyatt pree"> Mother of Dragons On behalf of the warlocks of Qarth, I welcome you A demonstration?
<name="pyatt pree"> Take this gem Look at it Into its depths So many facets Look closely enough and you can see yourself in them Often more than once
<name="pyatt pree"> Should you grow tired of Xaros baubles and trinkets, it would be an honor to host you at the House of the Undying You are always welcome, Mother of Dragons
<name="xaro"> My apologies Pyatt Pree is one of the Thirteen It was customary for me to extend him an invitation Customs die slow deaths in Qarth
<name="daenerys"> What is the House of the Undying?
<name="xaro"> It is where the warlocks go to squint at dusty books and drink shade of the evening It turns their lips blue and their minds soft So soft, they actually believe their parlor tricks are magic
<name="quaithe"> You watch over her
<name="jorah"> Do I know you?
<name="quaithe"> I know you Jorah Mormont of Bear Island
<name="jorah"> Who are you?
<name="quaithe"> Im no one But she is the Mother of Dragons She needs true protectors, now more than ever They shall come day and night to see the wonder born into the world again And when they see, they shall lust, for dragons are fire made flesh And fire is power
<name="brienne"> It looked like Stannis
<name="catelyn"> To me it just looked like A shadow in the shape of a man
<name="brienne"> In the shape of Stannis
<name="catelyn"> We should reach my sons camp tomorrow
<name="brienne"> Will you stay there long, my lady?
<name="catelyn"> Only long enough to tell Robb what I have seen After that, I will leave for Winterfell My two youngest need me Ive been away from them for far too long
<name="brienne"> I never knew my mother
<name="catelyn"> Im sorry
<name="catelyn"> My own mother died on the birthing bed when I was very young
<name="brienne"> Its a bloody business
<name="catelyn"> What comes after is even harder
<name="brienne"> Once youre safely back amongst your own people, will you give me leave to go, my lady?
<name="catelyn"> You mean to kill Stannis
<name="brienne"> I swore a vow
<name="catelyn"> But Stannis has a great army around him His own guards are sworn to keep him safe
<name="catelyn"> Im as good as any of them I should never have fled
<name="catelyn"> Renlys death was no fault of yours You served him bravely
<name="brienne"> I only held him that once as he was dying
<name="catelyn"> Hes gone, Brienne You serve nothing and no one by following him into the earth Renlys enemies are Robbs enemies as well
<name="brienne"> I do not know your son, my lady But I could serve you, if you would have me You have courage Not battle courage, perhaps, but, I dont know, a womans kind of courage And I think that when the time comes, you will not hold me back Promise me that you will not hold me back from Stannis
<name="catelyn"> When the time comes, I will not hold you back
<name="brienne"> Then I am yours, my lady I will shield your back and give my life for yours, if it comes to that I swear it by the Old Gods and the new
<name="catelyn"> I vow that you shall always have a place in my home and at my table and that I shall ask no service of you that might bring you dishonor I swear it by the Old Gods and the new
<name="winterfell shepherd"> And its not just thieves, my lord Theres wolves in them hills now, more than I ever seen They come down in the night and they kill my sheep My three sons is away fighting for your brother, my lord Theyll fight, keep fighting till theyre told to go home I have no one to man my flock now Only me I cant keep watch all day and all night
<name="bran"> We can send two orphan boys from Winterstown home with you to help watch over your flock if you can give them room and board
<name="winterfell shepherd"> My wife always prayed for more children Well look after them Thank you, my lord And may the gods bless you and yours
<name="bran"> Stop it If thats everyone, Im going to go for a ride before dark
<name="luwin"> Good
<name="bran"> Hodor
<name="hodor"> Hodor
<name="rodrik"> Bran! Lord Stark Torrhens Square is under siege
<name="luwin"> Torrhens Square is barely 40 leagues from here How can the Lannisters strike so far north?
<name="rodrik"> Might be a raiding party led by the mountain Might be sellswords paid by Tywin Lannister
<name="bran"> We have to help them
<name="rodrik"> Most of the fighting men are away with Robb, but I can gather 200 decent men
<name="luwin"> Do you need so many?
<name="bran"> If we cant protect our own bannermen, why should they protect us? Go, Ser Rodrik Take the men you need
<name="rodrik"> Wont take long, my lord Southerners dont do well up here
<name="bran"> So, what does it mean?
<name="osha"> Ask your Maester Luwin Hes the one studying books all the time
<name="bran"> I did ask him Hed never heard of a three-eyed raven
<name="osha"> Must not mean anything, then
<name="bran"> Youre lying
<name="osha"> You might be a little lord, but dont you call me a liar
<name="bran"> You know what it means
<name="osha"> I never said I didnt
<name="bran"> You didnt give me an honest answer
<name="osha"> Thats not the same as being a liar
<name="bran"> Well, its not far off
<name="osha"> So, youve been dreaming of a three-eyed raven again? In the godswood, you told me you didnt dream Now whos a liar? What did you see in your dream?
<name="osha"> Something bad? Tell me, boy
<name="bran"> I dreamt that the sea came to Winterfell I saw waves crashing against the gates and the water came flowing over the walls It flooded the castle Drowned men were floating here, in the yard Ser Rodrik was one of them
<name="osha"> The sea is hundreds of miles away
<name="bran"> I know Its just a stupid dream
<name="osha"> Ive got to get these potatoes to the kitchen Otherwise theyll put me in chains again
<name="bran"> Osha The three-eyed raven, what do they say about it north of the Wall?
<name="osha"> They say all sorts of crazy things north of the Wall
<name="qhorin"> There
<name="jeor"> Where?
<name="qhorin"> On that mountain
<name="sam"> I dont see very well
<name="jon"> A fire
<name="qhorin"> Theres a fire The people sitting around it have better eyes than yours or mine When they see us coming, that fire becomes a signal Gives Mance Rayder plenty of time to throw a party in our honor
<name="jeor"> How many wildlings have joined him?
<name="qhorin"> From what we can tell, all of them Mance has gathered them all like deer against the wolves Theyre almost ready to make their move
<name="jon"> Where?
<name="qhorin"> Somewhere safe Somewhere south Cant just march into their midst And we cant wait for them here with nothing but a pile of stones to protect us
<name="jeor"> You saying we should fall back to the Wall?
<name="qhorin"> Mance was one of us once Now hes one of them Hes going to teach them our way of doing things Theyll hit us in force and they wont run away when we hit back Theyre gonna be more organized than before, more disciplined, more like us So we need to be more like them, do things their way Sneak in, kill Mance, and scatter them to the winds before they can march on the Wall And to do that
<name="jeor"> We need to get rid of those lookouts
<name="qhorin"> Its not a job for 400 men I need to move fast and silent Harker, Stonesnake, Borba
<name="jon"> Lord Commander, Id like to join Lord Qhorin
<name="qhorin"> Ive been called lots of things, but that might be my first Lord Qhorin Youre a steward, Snow, not a ranger
<name="jon"> Ive fought and killed a wight How many rangers can say that?
<name="qhorin"> Hes the one?
<name="jeor"> Aye You killed a wight You also let an old man beat you bloody and take your sword
<name="qhorin"> Craster? In the boys defense, thats a tough old goat
<name="sam"> I could take up Jons duties while hes gone, my lord It would be no trouble
<name="jeor"> Well, I hope you make a better ranger than you do a steward Go on
<name="xaro"> So, tell me, how long has your manservant been in love with you?
<name="daenerys"> Hes not my manservant and hes not in love with me Hes my advisor and hes my friend
<name="xaro"> Unlikely I can almost always tell what a man wants
<name="daenerys"> And what about what a woman wants?
<name="xaro"> Much more complicated You, for example, what do you want?
<name="daenerys"> To cross the Narrow Sea and take back the Iron Throne
<name="xaro"> Why?
<name="daenerys"> Because I promised my khalasar Id protect them and find them a safe home
<name="xaro"> You want to conquer the Seven Kingdoms for the Dothraki?
<name="daenerys"> I want them because theyre mine by right The Iron Throne is mine and I will take it
<name="xaro"> Ah, a conqueror
<name="daenerys"> And how did you get all of this? Did someone give it to you?
<name="xaro"> No I come from nothing I hit the docks like a piece of cargo, except someone normally cares what happens to cargo
<name="daenerys"> So you wanted more than you had and you took it Youre a conqueror, too Youre just less ambitious
<name="daenerys"> What do you want, Xaro Xhoan Daxos? At the gates of the city, you bled for me Why?
<name="xaro"> I will show you why
<name="xaro"> The door and the vault is made of Valyrian stone The hardest steel does not make a mark I offered the greatest locksmiths in Qarth their weight in gold if they could break into it I made the same offer to the greatest thieves They all went home empty-handed The only thing that can open this door is this key
<name="daenerys"> And behind the door?
<name="daenerys"> And it can all be mine?
<name="xaro"> All? Let us say half More than enough to buy horses, ships, armies Enough to go home
<name="daenerys"> All I have to do?
<name="xaro"> Is marry me
<name="daenerys"> That was a romantic proposal
<name="xaro"> Ive already married once for love, but the gods stole her from me I come from nothing My mother and father never owned a pair of shoes But marry me, and I will give you the Seven Kingdoms and our children will be princes and princesses
<name="xaro"> See? I have more ambition than you thought The time is right, Daenerys Targaryen, First of Your Name Robert Baratheon is dead
<name="jorah"> If you cross the sea with an army you bought and a foreign husband who paid for it
<name="daenerys"> The Seven Kingdoms are at war with one another Four false kings destroying the country
<name="jorah"> To win Westeros, you need support from Westeros
<name="daenerys"> The usurper is dead
<name="daenerys"> The Starks fight the Lannisters, and Baratheons fight each other
<name="jorah"> According to your new friend who earned your trust by cutting his hand?
<name="daenerys"> The time to strike is now We need to find ships and an army or well spend the rest of our lives rotting away at the edge of the world
<name="jorah"> Rich men do not become rich by giving more than they get Theyll give you ships and soldiers and theyll own you forever Moving carefully is the hard way, but its the right way
<name="daenerys"> And if Id listened to that advice outside the gates of Qarth, wed all be dead by now
<name="jorah"> I know the opportunity before you seems like the last youll ever have,
<name="daenerys"> Do not speak to me like Im a child
<name="jorah"> I only want
<name="daenerys"> What do you want? Tell me
<name="jorah"> To see you on the Iron Throne
<name="daenerys"> Why?
<name="jorah"> You have a good claim A title A birthright But you have something more than that You may cover it up and deny it, but you have a gentle heart You would not only be respected and feared, you would be loved Someone who can rule and should rule Centuries come and go without a person like that coming into the world There are times when I look at you and I still cant believe youre real
<name="daenerys"> So what would you have me do, as my advisor?
<name="jorah"> Make your own way Find your own ship You only need one The allies we need are in Westeros, not Qarth
<name="daenerys"> And how do I get the ship?
<name="jorah"> Ill find it for you A sound ship with a good captain
<name="daenerys"> I look forward to meeting him
<name="jorah"> Khaleesi
<name="arya"> You should stand sideface
<name="gendry"> Sideface?
<name="arya"> Sideways
<name="gendry"> Why?
<name="arya"> Smaller target
<name="gendry"> Am I fighting someone?
<name="arya"> Youre practicing for a fight You should practice right
<name="gold cloak"> Guards! Did you see anything? Go up there Go and see where he fell from
<name="gold cloak"> Go up the battlement
<name="woman"> That is strange

<name="varys"> Who threatened you?
<name="tyrion"> Im not Ned Stark I understand the way this game is played
<name="varys"> Ned Stark was a man of honor
<name="tyrion"> And I am not Threaten me again and I will have you thrown into the sea
<name="varys"> You might be disappointed in the results The storms come and go The big fish eat the little fish And I keep on paddling Come, my lord We shouldnt keep the queen waiting
<name="cersei"> From this time until the end of time, we are not part of your realm, but a free and independent Kingdom of the North.” He has more spirit than his father, Ill give him that
<name="tyrion"> Youve perfected the art of tearing up papers Give him his fathers bones back, at least, as a gesture of good faith
<name="cersei"> Youll give the Starks our reply, cousin?
<name="alton"> I will, Your Grace
<name="cersei"> Did you see my brother when you were the Starks guest?
<name="alton"> I did They have not broken his spirit, Your Grace
<name="cersei"> If you speak with him, tell him hes not been forgotten
<name="alton"> I will, Your Grace
<name="tyrion"> Safe travels, cousin
<name="tyrion"> You have a deft hand with diplomacy
<name="cersei"> If thats everything?
<name="pycelle"> A raven flew in this morning from Castle Black
<name="varys"> Trouble with the wildlings?
<name="littlefinger"> Thats why theyre called wildlings
<name="varys"> Somewhat less wild these days It seems theyve stopped killing each other and started following this King-Beyond-the-Wall
<name="cersei"> Another king? How many is that now, Five? Ive lost count
<name="tyrion"> Lord Commander asks that we send more men to man The Wall
<name="cersei"> Perhaps hes forgotten were fighting a war We have no men to spare
<name="tyrion"> Cold winds are rising, and the dead rise with them
<name="pycelle"> The northerners are a superstitious people
<name="tyrion"> According to the Commander, one of these dead men attacked him in his chambers Mormont doesnt lie
<name="varys"> How do you kill a dead man?
<name="tyrion"> Apparently you burn him
<name="cersei"> One trip to The Wall and you come back believing in grumpkins and snarks
<name="tyrion"> I dont know what I believe, but heres a fact for you The Nights Watch is the only thing that separates us from what lies beyond the Wall
<name="cersei"> I have every confidence the brave men of the Nights Watch will protect us all
<name="edd"> Then I said, if the gods wanted us to have dignity, wouldnt make us fart when we died
<name="grenn"> We fart when we die?
<name="edd"> My blessed mother was holding her own when she left this world She farted so hard, the whole bed shook
<name="sam"> Seems a bit greedy for one man to have so many wives Wouldnt two, or three, be enough for him?
<name="edd"> We were having a serious discussion
<name="grenn"> Would you look at that
<name="sam"> Nothing like the sight of a woman walking away
<name="grenn"> I prefer watching them come towards me
<name="sam"> Im sure thats nice too

<name="sam"> You were cruel
<name="jon"> Cruel! Sam are you in such a hurry to lose a hand?
<name="sam"> I didnt touch her
<name="jon"> No you just want to steal her What do you think Craster cuts off for that?
<name="sam"> I cant steal her, shes a person not a goat
<name="jon"> Were heading deeper and deeper into wildling territory We cant take a girl with us Mormont wouldnt have it And even if he would, what would we do with her? Whos gonna deliver her baby? You?

<name="daenerys"> They will like it far less when Im done with them
<name="irri"> No! They killed his soul
<name="daenerys"> Shh They cannot kill his soul
<name="irri"> They did! They butchered him like an animal They did not burn his body He can never join his ancestors in the night lands

<name="theon"> Theyll be waiting for me on the docks
<name="woman"> Who will?
<name="theon"> Anyone who matters, , this is a big day for them They havent had much to get excited about since I left Its a hard place the Iron Islands always has been Its cold and its wet
<name="woman"> I love the cold and wet
<name="theon"> They say hard places breed hard men, , and hard men rule the world
<name="woman"> Then youll be king before long
<name="theon"> Try smiling with your lips closed Hmm, better
<name="woman"> My father doesnt trust you Iron islanders
<name="theon"> I dont blame him
<name="woman"> He says that youre all reavers and rapers And that no matter how many women you have, youll never be satis
<name="theon"> Quit talking about your father Hes right about us Our wives from the Iron Islands, theyre for breeding Thats not enough for us Thats why we take saltwives, from the women we capture
<name="woman"> Capture me! Take me with you when you go ashore Make me your saltwife
<name="theon"> Your place is on this ship
<name="woman"> Not after you leave Father will punish me Hell call me a whore
<name="theon"> I havent paid you

<name="littlefinger"> One moment, my friend A moment
<name="littlefinger"> Please accept my sincerest apologies Ramka will take good care of you
<name="roz"> I’m sorry, my lord

<name="littlefinger"> Who?
<name="roz"> She works for you Shes the one, the girl whose, they killed her baby
<name="littlefinger"> Ah, yes, that was poorly handled Sometimes those with the most power have the least grace
<name="roz"> Cant stop thinking about it, I cant sleep Her poor little baby
<name="littlefinger"> You know, you remind me of another girl A lovely thing I once acquired from an Elysium pleasure house Beautiful, like yourself, and intelligent as yourself But she wasnt happy She cried, often I asked her why but, we didnt have the kind of rapport that you and I have Yes, it was quite sad Girls from Elysium pleasure houses are expensive Extremely expensive And this one wasnt making me any money I hate bad investments Really, I do They haunt me I had no idea how to make her happy, no idea how to mitigate my losses A very wealthy patron, he offered me a tremendous amount of money to let him transform this lovely, sad girl To use her in ways that never occur to most men And you know what occurs to most men I would not say he succeeded in making her happy but my losses were definitely mitigated Take tonight off to mourn Mhaegen’s child I’ll see you tomorrow But you’ll be happy? That makes me happy
<name="podrick"> More wine?
<name="janos"> Damn it, boy
<name="podrick"> Apologies, my lord

<name="tyrion"> Myself, I prefer the improper ones
<name="janos"> Hmm, thats a good red Dornish?
<name="tyrion"> You know your wines, my lord
<name="janos"> That I do A fine dinner, my lord
<name="tyrion"> Call me Tyrion, please Im sure youre getting used to fine dinners, now that youre a lord
<name="janos"> Maybe Ill hire this cook of yours
<name="tyrion"> Wars have been started for less
<name="tyrion"> I heard there was some trouble in Littlefingers brothel the other night
<name="janos"> Hmm Nasty business, had to be done
<name="tyrion"> Yes, of course City Watch must keep the peace Only, I hadnt realized peace depended on killing babies
<name="janos"> Orders are orders
<name="tyrion"> Quite right Especially the queens orders
<name="janos"> I never said they were the queens orders
<name="tyrion"> No, but who else would want to murder King Roberts bastards? Shes always been a jealous woman
<name="janos"> You know your sister better than I do
<name="tyrion"> Youve heard the awful rumors about my brother and sister
<name="janos"> I dont listen to filth
<name="tyrion"> Thats good of you, but you have heard them I suppose people who do believe that filth, consider Roberts bastards to be better claimants to the throne than Cerseis children
<name="janos"> Joffrey is my king, the rest doesnt interest me
<name="tyrion"> I appreciate your loyalty Tell me When your men slaughtered Ned Starks men in the throne room, did you give the order?
<name="janos"> I did And I would again The man was a traitor He tried to buy my loyalty
<name="tyrion"> The fool! He had no idea you were already bought
<name="janos"> Are you drunk? Ill not have my honor questioned by an Imp
<name="tyrion"> Im not questioning your honor, Lord Janos Im denying its existence
<name="janos"> You think Ill stand here and take this from you, dwarf
<name="tyrion"> Dwarf? You should have stopped at imp And yes, you will stand here and take it from me, unless youd like to take it from my friend here
<name="tyrion"> I intend to serve as Hand of the King until my father returns from the war, and seeing as you betrayed the last Hand of the King, well, I just wouldnt feel safe with you lurking about
<name="janos"> What are you ta My friends at court will not allow this The queen herself
<name="tyrion"> The queen regent And youre a fool to believe shes your friend
<name="janos"> We shall hear what Joffrey has to say about this
<name="tyrion"> No, we shant
<name="tyrion"> Theres a ship leaving for East Watch by the sea tonight From there, Im afraid its rather a long walk to Castle Black I hope you enjoy the Wall I found it surprisingly beautiful, in a brutal, horribly uncomfortable sort of way
<name="bronn"> The lads will escort you The streets arent safe at night, my lord
<name="janos"> These men are under my command I command you to arrest this cutthroat
<name="tyrion"> His name is Bronn and he is the new commander of the City Watch
<name="bronn"> Boys?
<name="janos"> I have friends at court! Powerful friends! The king himself made me a lord!Janos is escorted out of view Bronn sits down, and Tyrion pours him a cup of wine
<name="tyrion"> To the new Commander
<name="tyrion"> If I told you to murder, an infant girl say, still at her mothers breast, would you do it without question?
<name="bronn"> Without question? No Id ask how much

<name="hot pie"> Ive seen lots of battles I saw
<name="arya"> Liar
<name="hot pie"> I saw a man kill another man just outside a tavern in Flea Bottom Stabbed him right in the neck
<name="lommy"> Two men fighting isnt a battle
<name="hot pie"> They had armor on
<name="arya"> So?

<name="gendry"> Well, I don’t care what any of them want No goods ever come of their questions
<name="arya"> No goods ever come? Who asked questions before?
<name="gendry"> How can someone so small be such a huge pain in my ass?
<name="arya"> Who asked questions?

<name="arya"> Lord Stark

<name="gendry"> My mom
<name="arya"> Whos your mom?
<name="gendry"> Just my mom Worked in a tavern Died when I was little
<name="arya"> And who was your father?

<name="theon"> You should give me the reins, Im a better rider than you Ive been on horseback for the last nine years
<name="yara"> Nine years Do you still know your way around a ship? Have these hands ever touched a rope?
<name="theon"> Dont you worry about my hands The seas in my blood
<name="yara"> Your blood will be in the sea if I dont watch where Im going
<name="theon"> I have a proposal for my father One that will make him king again And me after him You may stay at the castle tonight, if youre lucky
<name="yara"> Is that an offer from my future king?

<name="theon"> A man Your blood and your heir
<name="balon"> We shall see Stark had you longer than I did
<name="theon"> Lord Stark is gone
<name="balon"> And how do you feel about that?
<name="theon"> Whats done is done Ive brought you a proposal from Robb Stark
<name="balon"> Who gave you those clothes? Was it Ned Starks pleasure to make you his daughter?
<name="theon"> If my clothes offend you, I will change them
<name="balon"> It will That bauble around your neck Did you pay the iron price for it or the gold? I asked a question Did you pull it from the neck of a corpse you made or did you buy it to match your fine clothes? Iron or gold?
<name="theon"> Gold
<name="balon"> Ill not have my son dressed as a whore My fears have come true The Starks have made you theirs
<name="theon"> My blood is salt and iron
<name="balon"> Yet, , the Stark boy sends you to me like a trained raven, clutching his message
<name="theon"> The offer he makes, is one I proposed
<name="balon"> He heeds your counsel?
<name="theon"> Ive lived with him, hunted with him, fought at his side, he thinks of me as a brother
<name="balon"> No, not here, , not in my hearing, you will not name him brother This son of the man who put your true brothers to the sword Or have you forgotten your own blood?
<name="theon"> I forget nothing I remember my brothers And I remember when my father was a king
<name="balon"> I see I destroy Robb Starks enemies for him and he will make me King of the Iron Islands once again
<name="theon"> I will lead the attack myself
<name="balon"> Oh, you will?
<name="theon"> Im your son Your only living heir Who else?
<name="theon"> I told you to wait outside How did you get past the guards?
<name="yara"> Anything with a cock is easy to fool

<name="theon"> Yara?
<name="yara"> So good to see you, brother This is a homecoming Ill tell my grandchildren about
<name="theon"> She cant lead an attack
<name="balon"> And why not?

<name="yara"> Youre the one in skirts
<name="balon"> This isnt Winterfell, boy Your sister took over command of your eldest brothers ship after your new father killed him
<name="all three"> Whats dead may never die The only night shes spent off these islands has been spent on the sea Shes commanded men Shes killed men She knows who she is
<name="balon"> No man gives me a crown I pay the iron price I will take my crown That is who I am That is who we have always been
<name="theon"> You wont stand a chance against the Lannisters on your own
<name="balon"> Who said anything about the Lannisters?
<name="davos"> Youll have your gold when we take the treasury at Kings Landing
<name="saan"> All these kings fighting for the throne, and this Stannis has the smallest army Why would I bet on the man with the worst chance?
<name="davos"> Because youre a smart gambler Stannis has proved himself in war Twice His baby brother has never set foot on a battlefield Neither has the false king, Joffrey
<name="saan"> And yet, they both have larger armies
<name="davos"> Stannis has just begun the fight His bannermen will rally to his cause Theres no man in the Seven Kingdoms more honorable than Stannis Baratheon Or more worthy of loyalty
<name="saan"> What is the world coming to when smugglers must vouch for the honor of kings
<name="matthos"> Mind your words, pirate
<name="davos"> Matthos
<name="saan"> You think Im insulted? I am a pirate Im an excellent pirate I dont sail for promises
<name="davos"> Of course you do Every time you leave harbor, youre leaving on a promise A promise that somewhere on the seas, somebodys got some gold and you can take it from them
<name="saan"> Thats a promise that always comes true
<name="davos"> As is mine Youre not the young man, Salladhor And correct me if Im wrong Most pirates dont grow old
<name="saan"> Only the clever ones
<name="davos"> You want to spend your last few years on the sea, stealing from Pentoshi cheesemongers and Midanese silk merchants, then go Theyre out there waiting for you Thats easy What Im offering you is hard Come with me and plunder the greatest city in Westeros Youll be the richest man in Lysene And the most famous Theyll be singing songs about you as long as men have voices to sing
<name="saan"> Salladhor Saan is a good name for songs
<name="davos"> It is
<name="saan"> One thing, I want the queen
<name="davos"> The queen?
<name="saan"> Cersei, I want her Ill sail with your fleet, all 30 of my ships, and if we dont drown at the bottom of Blackwater Bay, I will fuck this blonde queen and I will fuck her well
<name="matthos"> This war isnt about you Were not attacking Kings Landing so that you can rape the queen
<name="saan"> Im not going to rape her, Im going to fuck her
<name="matthos"> As if she would just let you
<name="saan"> You dont know how persuasive I am I never tried to fuck you
<name="matthos"> Stannis is the rightful king, and the Lord of Light The one true god
<name="saan"> Ive been all over the world, my boy, and everywhere I go, people tell me about the true god They all think they found the right one The one true god is whats between a womans legs, and better yet a queens legs
<name="saan"> I never thought youd have a true believer for a son
<name="davos"> Hes young yet I promise you the gold I promise you the glory I cannot promise you the queen
<name="matthos"> You believe your king can win?
<name="davos"> He is the one true king
<name="saan"> You Westerosee are funny people A man chops off your fingers and you fall in love with him Ill sail with you, Davos Seaworth You are the most honest smuggler I ever met Make me rich
<name="davos"> Get me to the gates of Kings Landing and I will
<name="matthos"> When will the King have a sail?
<name="davos"> As soon as his God wills it
<name="matthos"> Hes my God too, and yours But you were too blind to see Let me teach you how to read
<name="davos"> Oh you and your mother
<name="matthos"> It wont take long You already know the letters The holy books are much more persuasive than I can be
<name="davos"> I wish I had a God, truly! Im not mocking you, but Ive seen men pray to every God there is Pray for wind, pray for rain, pray for home None of it works
<name="matthos"> But you always came home
<name="davos"> I wasnt praying
<name="matthos"> But I was Every night that you were at sea, I lit a candle and I prayed, for you
<name="davos"> You want me to have a god, fine King Stannis is my god He raised me up and blessed me with his trust He gave you a future I could never have imagined You know how to read, youll be a knight someday You think your fire god commanded all that? It was Stannis Only Stannis
<name="matthos"> Stannis is my king, but hes only a man
<name="davos"> Dont tell him that
<name="cersei"> Lord Janos Slynt was Commander of the City Watch You had no right to exile him
<name="tyrion"> I have every right I am the Kings Hand
<name="cersei"> Youre serving as the Kings Hand until father gets here I am Queen Regent
<name="tyrion"> Listen to me, Queen Regent, youre losing the people Do you hear me?
<name="cersei"> Ha, the people You think I care?
<name="tyrion"> You might find it difficult to rule over millions who want you dead Half the city will starve when winter comes The other half will plot to overthrow you And your gold-plated thugs just gave them the rallying cry, The Queen slaughters babies.” You dont even have the decency to deny it
<name="tyrion"> It wasnt you who gave the order, was it? Joffrey didnt even tell you Or did he tell you? I imagine that would be even worse
<name="cersei"> He did what needed to be done You want to be the Hand of the King? You want to rule? This is what ruling is! Lying on a bed of weeds, ripping them out by the root one by one before they strangle you in your sleep
<name="tyrion"> Im no king, but I think theres more to ruling that that
<name="cersei"> I dont care what you think! Youve never taken it seriously You havent, Jaime hasnt Its all fallen on me
<name="tyrion"> As has Jaime repeatedly, according to Stannis Baratheon
<name="cersei"> Youre funny Youve always been funny But none of your jokes will ever match the first one, will they? You remember back when you ripped my mother open on your way out of her and she bled to death
<name="tyrion"> She was my mother too
<name="cersei"> Now theyre gone, for the sake of you Theres no bigger joke in the world than that
<name="davos"> Your Grace
<name="matthos"> Your Grace
<name="stannis"> How did it fare with your pirate?
<name="davos"> Salladhor Saan will join our fleet 30 ships His men know how to fight
<name="stannis"> In my experience, pirates prefer fighting unarmed men
<name="davos"> Does seem the wiser choice
<name="stannis"> It wont be a choice this time Do you trust him?
<name="davos"> Salladhor Saan is an old friend, Ive known him 30 years Ive never trusted him But once he gets the smell of gold, he never stops
<name="stannis"> Well if he does his job, hell have his share Leave us
<name="davos"> At once, Your Grace
<name="melisandre"> The Lord of Light shines through you, young warrior
<name="davos"> Come
<name="stannis"> What did you say to him?
<name="melisandre"> I told him death by fire is the purest death
<name="stannis"> Why?
<name="melisandre"> Because it is true Youre troubled my king
<name="stannis"> Yeah
<name="melisandre"> These armies are but toys for the Lord of Light
<name="stannis"> Tell your lord to burn them then
<name="melisandre"> I tell him nothing! I pray for his commands and I obey
<name="stannis"> My little brother has a hundred thousand men according to the scouts Men whose allegiance rightly belongs to me
<name="melisandre"> You must have faith
<name="stannis"> Faith? In a real war, the side with the greater number wins nine times out of ten
<name="melisandre"> Then we must be the ten
<name="stannis"> I cannot defeat my brother in the field, and I cant take Kings Landing without the men he stole
<name="melisandre"> I have seen the path to victory in the flames At first, you must give yourself to the Lord of Light
<name="stannis"> Ive said the words, damn you! I burnt the idols
<name="melisandre"> You must give all of yourself
<name="stannis"> I have a wife I took a vow
<name="melisandre"> Shes sick Weak Shut away in the tower And she disgusts you And shes given you nothing No sons Only stillborns Only death I will give you a son, my King
<name="stannis"> A son?

<name="sansa"> You cant
<name="joffrey"> What did you say? Did you say I cant?
<name="sansa"> I only meant it would be bad luck to kill a man on your name day
<name="joffrey"> What kind of stupid peasants superstition.
<name="sandor"> The girl is right What a man sows on his name day, he reaps all year
<name="joffrey"> Take him away Ill have him killed tomorrow, the fool
<name="sansa"> He is A fool youre so clever to see it Hell make a much better fool than a knight He doesnt deserve the mercy of a quick death
<name="joffrey"> Did you hear My Lady, Ser Dontos? From this day, , youll be my new fool
<name="ser dontos"> Thank you, Your Grace And you, My Lady, thank you
<name="tyrion"> Beloved nephew
<name="tyrion"> We looked for you on the battlefield You were nowhere to be found
<name="joffrey"> Ive been here, ruling the kingdoms
<name="tyrion"> What a fine job youve done Look at you More beautiful than ever And you! You, youre going to be bigger than the Hound, but much better looking This one doesnt like me
<name="bronn"> Cant imagine why
<name="joffrey"> We heard you were dead
<name="myrcella"> Im glad youre not dead
<name="tyrion"> Me, too, dear Death is so boring, especially now with so much excitement in the world My Lady, Im sorry for your loss
<name="joffrey"> Her loss? Her father was a confessed traitor
<name="tyrion"> But still her father Surely having so recently lost your own beloved father you can sympathize
<name="sansa"> My father was a traitor My mother and brother are traitors, too I am loyal to my beloved Joffrey
<name="tyrion"> Of course you are
<name="tyrion"> Well, , enjoy your name day, Your Grace Wish I could stay and celebrate, but there is work to be done
<name="joffrey"> What work? Why are you here?
<name="pycelle"> The raven arrived from the Citadel this morning, Your Grace The conclave has met, , considered reports from Maesters all over the Seven Kingdoms, and declared this great summer done, at last The longest summer in living memory
<name="varys"> The peasants say, a long summer means an even longer winter
<name="pycelle"> A common superstition
<name="littlefinger"> We have enough wheat for a five-year winter If it lasts any longer, , well have fewer peasants
<name="janos"> The citys drowning in refugees, Your Grace, fleeing the war We have nowhere to house them, and with winter coming, itll only get worse
<name="cersei"> You command the City Watch, do you not, Lord Slynt?
<name="janos"> I do, Your Grace
<name="cersei"> And are you not a Lord at my command?
<name="janos"> I owe my title and lands to your generosity, Your Grace
<name="cersei"> Then do your job Shut the gates to the peasants They belong in the field, not our capital
<name="janos"> Yes, Your Grace
<name="tyrion"> Dont get up More ravishing than ever, big sister War agrees with you Forgive the interruption, carry on
<name="cersei"> What are you doing here?
<name="tyrion"> Its been a remarkable journey I, , pissed off the edge of the Wall, I slept in a sky cell I fought with the hill tribes So many adventures, so much to be thankful for
<name="cersei"> What are you doing here? This is the small council
<name="tyrion"> Yes., well, I, do believe the Hand of the King is welcome at all small council meetings
<name="cersei"> Our father is Hand of the King
<name="tyrion"> Yes, but in his absence
<name="varys"> Your father has named Lord Tyrion to serve as Hand in his stead while he fights
<name="cersei"> Out! All of you out I would like to know how you tricked father into this
<name="tyrion"> If I were capable of tricking father, Id be emperor of the world by now You brought this on yourself
<name="cersei"> Ive done nothing
<name="tyrion"> Quite right You did nothing when your son called for Ned Starks head Now the entire North has risen up against us
<name="cersei"> I tried to stop it
<name="tyrion"> Did you? You failed That bit of theater will haunt our family for a generation
<name="cersei"> Robb Stark is a child
<name="tyrion"> Whos won every battle hes fought Do you understand were losing the war?
<name="cersei"> What do you know about warfare?
<name="tyrion"> Nothing But I know people And I know that our enemies hate each other almost as much as they hate us
<name="cersei"> Joffrey is King
<name="tyrion"> Joffrey is King
<name="cersei"> You are here to advise him
<name="tyrion"> Im only here to advise him And if the King listens to what I say, the King might just get his Uncle Jaime back
<name="cersei"> How?
<name="tyrion"> You love your children Its your one redeeming quality That and your cheekbones The Starks love their children as well And we have two of them
<name="cersei"> One
<name="tyrion"> One?
<name="cersei"> Arya, little animal, she disappeared
<name="tyrion"> Disappeared? What, in a puff of smoke? We had three Starks to trade You chopped ones head off and let another escape Father will be furious It must be odd for you to be the disappointing child
<name="lord"> My Lord, may the Old Gods watch over your brother and all our northern sons
<name="lord"> The walls of my Holdfast will not stand the winter The stones were last mortared in the time of King Aerys, and Im afraid the masons today are not fit to carry their fathers hammers When I was a boy, I remember seeing them put up a new tower at Torrhens Square in a summer Men worked back then Today, my Holdfast looks like it was built by drunk children At night you can hear the wind howling through the gaps And the Gods forbid it rains Why, I might as well sleep beneath a waterfall
<name="luwin"> Maintenance of a Holdfast generally falls to the lord of that Holdfast
<name="lord"> Generally, yes, but Ive sent all the young men off to fight Robb Starks war
<name="bran"> King Robb And its not his war He didnt choose it
<name="lord"> Maybe not, My Lord, but he called in his Banners, and took the men
<name="bran"> Joffrey killed my father, your liege lord Do you remember your vows, Ser?
<name="lord"> Of course I remember
<name="luwin"> We can spare four masons for a week, My Lord Will that be sufficient to repair your walls?
<name="lord"> I I believe it will
<name="luwin"> We didnt want him here all day, did we?
<name="bran"> I didnt like the way he was talking about Robb
<name="luwin"> Nor did I But listening to people youd rather not listen to is one of your responsibilities as Lord of Winterfell Lord Portan
<name="portan"> My Lord, may the Old Gods watch over your brother and all our northern sons
<name="osha"> Boil this for an hour and drink the tea Makes all your pain go away
<name="bran"> Dont have any pain
<name="osha"> Lucky for you
<name="bran"> That way
<name="osha"> Youve been having those dreams again
<name="bran"> I dont dream
<name="osha"> Everyone dreams
<name="bran"> I dont Heard some of the men talking about the comet They say its an omen They say it means Robb will win a great victory in the South
<name="osha"> Did they? I heard some other fools say its Lannister Red Means the Lannisters will rule all Seven Kingdoms before long I heard a stable boy say its the color of blood, to mark the death of your father
<name="osha"> The stars dont fall for men The red comet means one thing, boy Dragons
<name="bran"> The dragons are all dead Theyve been dead for centuries
<name="doreah"> What did your brother say about them, Khaleesi?
<name="daenerys"> He said they ate meat
<name="doreah"> He didnt tell you what kind of meat?
<name="daenerys"> My brother didnt know anything about dragons He didnt know anything about anything
<name="daenerys"> She was Drogos first gift to me
<name="jorah"> I remember
<name="daenerys"> I promised to protect them Promised them their enemies would die screaming How do I make starvation scream?
<name="jorah"> A trick I never learned, Im afraid
<name="daenerys"> Does it ever end?
<name="jorah"> This is further east than Ive ever been But, yes, Khaleesi, everything ends, even the red waste
<name="daenerys"> And youre sure theres no other way?
<name="jorah"> If we go south to the land of the Lazarheen, the Lamb Men will kill us and take your dragons If we go west to the Dothraki Sea, the first Khalasar we meet will kill us and take your dragons
<name="daenerys"> No one will take my dragons
<name="jorah"> They are too weak to fight, as are your people You must be their strength
<name="daenerys"> As you are mine
<name="daenerys"> Rakharo, Aggo, Kovarro Take our remaining horses You will ride east, you southeast, and you northeast
<name="rakharo"> What do we seek, Khaleesi?
<name="daenerys"> Cities, living or dead Caravans and people Rivers or lakes or the great salt sea Find how far the Red Waste extends before us, and what lies on the other side
<name="daenerys"> Rokharo, you are my last hope, blood of my blood
<name="rakharo"> I will not fail you, blood of my blood
<name="daenerys"> You never have
<name="rakharo"> This is bad time to start
<name="jon"> Having a rough time of it?
<name="sam"> Nothings killed me yet
<name="grenn"> Your ass killed the sledge
<name="sam"> You offered me a ride
<name="grenn"> I just wanted you to shut up about your damn blisters
<name="edd"> I was born in a place like this Later, I fell on hard times The camera moves through the camp, to show some of the women working
<name="sam"> Are those girls?
<name="edd"> Crasters daughters
<name="sam"> I havent seen a girl in six months
<name="edd"> Id keep on not seeing them if I were you
<name="grenn"> What, he dont like people messing with his daughters?
<name="edd"> He dont like people messing with his wives
<name="edd"> He marries his daughters, and they give him more daughters, and on, and on it goes
<name="sam"> Thats foul
<name="grenn"> Its beyond foul
<name="edd"> All the other wildlings for a hundred leagues have disappeared Crasters still here He must be doing something right
<name="jon"> What happens to the boys?
<name="sam"> Hmm?
<name="jon"> He marries his daughters What does he do with his sons?
<name="lord"> He said he planned to stop here on his way to the Frostfangs
<name="craster"> People make all sorts of plans I havent seen Benjen Stark in three years Havent missed him Always treated me like scum Havent had any good wine for a long time You Southerners make good wine, Ill give you that
<name="jon"> Were not Southerners
<name="craster"> Whos this little girl? Youre prettier than half my daughters You got a nice wet twat between your legs? Whats your name?
<name="jon"> Jon Snow
<name="craster"> Snow, eh? Listen to me, bastard All you lot from south of the Wall, youre Southerners But now youre in the North, the real North
<name="lord"> The lad meant no harm
<name="craster"> I catch that pretty little bastard talking to my daughters
<name="lord"> No one will talk to your daughters, you have my word Now, sit down and shut your mouth
<name="craster"> You bring any of that good wine with you?
<name="lord"> We did We passed through six villages on the way here All six were abandoned Where have all the wildlings gone?
<name="craster"> I could tell you, but Im thirsty
<name="lord"> Theres a barrel of Dornish wine on the sledge Bring it in here
<name="watchman"> Yes, commander
<name="craster"> You want to know where theyve all gone? North! To join up with Mance Rayder Your old friend
<name="lord"> Hes no friend of mine He broke his vows, betrayed his brothers
<name="craster"> Oh, aye But once he was just a poor black crow And now hes King-Beyond-the-Wall
<name="lord"> Hes been calling himself that for years What’s he king of? A frozen lake somewhere?
<name="craster"> Thats a good-looking axe Fresh forged?
<name="lord"> Give it here
<name="lord"> Youll have another one made at Castle Black Here
<name="craster"> Oh, thats some lovely steel You want to know what Mance Rayder is doing? Gathering an army What I hear, hes already got more men than any of your southern kings
<name="lord"> And where does he plan marching this army?
<name="craster"> When youre all the way north, theres only one direction to go
<name="lord"> These are bad times to be living alone in the wild The cold winds are rising
<name="craster"> Let them come My roots are sunk deep Wife, tell the Lord Crow how content we are
<name="gilly"> This is our place Our husband keeps us safe Better to live free than die a slave
<name="craster"> Dont it make you jealous, old man, to see me with all these young wives and you with no one to warm your bed?
<name="lord"> We chose different paths
<name="craster"> Oh, aye, and you chose the path with no one but boys on it Youll be wanting to sleep beneath my roof, I suppose, and eat me out of pigs
<name="lord"> A roof would be welcome Its been hard riding Weve brought our own food and good steel for you
<name="craster"> Any man lays a hand on one of my wives, he loses the hand And I see this one, , staring too long, I might just gouge his eyes out
<name="lord"> Your roof, your rules
<name="lord"> Who am I? Who am I?
<name="jon"> Lord commander
<name="lord"> And who are you?
<name="jon"> Jon Snow
<name="lord"> Who are you?
<name="jon"> Your steward
<name="lord"> You want to lead one day? Then learn how to follow
<name="melisandre"> Lord of Light, come to us in our darkness We offer you these false Gods
<name="melisandre"> Take them and cast your light upon us For the night is dark and full of terrors
<name="the group"> For the night is dark and full of terrors
<name="melisandre"> After the long summer, darkness will fall heavy on the world Stars will bleed
<name="cressen"> We need to stop her
<name="melisandre"> The cold breath of winter will freeze the seas
<name="davos"> Not now
<name="melisandre"> And the dead shall rise in the North
<name="cressen"> All you men were named in the Light of the Seven! Is this how you treat the Gods of your fathers? Are you so eager to spit on your ancestors?
<name="melisandre"> You smell of fear, fear and piss and old bones Do you want to stop me? Stop me
<name="melisandre"> In the ancient books, its written that a warrior will draw a burning sword from the fire And that sword shall be Lightbringer Stannis Baratheon, warrior of light, your sword awaits you
<name="crowd"> Lord, cast your light upon us
<name="melisandre"> For the night is dark and full of terrors
<name="stannis"> For the night is dark and full of terror
<name="cressen"> This woman will lead him into a war he cannot win
<name="davos"> Stannis is our king We follow where he leads, even if we dont like the path
<name="cressen"> King Since that boar killed his brother, every lord wants a coronation
<name="davos"> I dont serve the others I serve Stannis
<name="cressen"> As do I, but loyal service means telling hard truths Hes surrounded by fools and fanatics, but he trusts you, Davos If you tell him the truth
<name="davos"> Whats the truth?
<name="matthos"> And I declare upon the honor of my house that my beloved brother Robert le-
<name="stannis"> He wasnt my beloved brother I didnt love him, he didnt love me
<name="davos"> A harmless courtesy, Your Grace
<name="stannis"> A lie Take it out
<name="matthos"> That my brother Robert left no trueborn heirs; the boy Joffrey, the boy Tommen, and the girl Myrcella, being born of incest between Cersei Lannister and her brother Jaime Lannister By right of birth -
<name="stannis"> Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer Call him what he is
<name="matthos"> And her brother Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer By right of birth and blood, I do this day lay claim -
<name="stannis"> Make it Ser Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer Whatever else he is, the mans still a knight
<name="matthos"> Ser Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer By right of birth and blood, I do this day lay claim to the Iron Throne of Westeros Let all true men declare their loyalty
<name="stannis"> When Eddard Stark learned the truth, he told only me Ill not make the same mistake Send copies of that letter to every corner of the Realm, from the Arbor to the Wall The time has come to choose Let no man claim ignorance as an excuse
<name="davos"> Your Grace, the Lannisters are the true enemy If, for the time being, you could make peace with your brother
<name="stannis"> Ill not make peace with Renly while he calls himself King
<name="davos"> Well, many have already declared for him; Mace Tyrell, Randyll Tarly
<name="melisandre"> Stannis does not need to beg this lord or that lord for support The Lord of Light stands behind him
<name="davos"> And how many ships has the Lord of Light got in his fleet?
<name="melisandre"> He has no need for ships
<name="davos"> Im sure he doesnt, but we do if were going to war If not Renly, Your Grace, join forces with Robb Stark
<name="stannis"> Who would steal the northern half of my kingdom Ive always served thieves according to their desserts, as you well know, Ser Davos Joffrey, Renly, Robb Stark, theyre all thieves Theyll bend the knee or Ill destroy them
<name="cressen"> I owe you an apology, my King My duty is to serve You have chosen the new God over the Old Gods May the Lord of Light watch over us all Shall we drink together?
<name="davos"> Dont
<name="cressen"> A cup of wine to honor the one true God
<name="unphased melisandre"> The night is dark and full of terrors, old man, but the fire burns them all away Your Grace
<name="jaime"> King in the North I keep expecting you to leave me in one castle or another for safekeeping, but you drag me along from camp to camp Have you grown fond of me, Stark? Is that it? Ive never seen you with a girl
<name="robb"> If I left you with one of my bannermen, your father would know within a fortnight, and my bannerman would receive a raven with a message, Release my son and youll be rich beyond your dreams Refuse and your house will be destroyed, root and stem
<name="jaime"> You dont trust the loyalty of the men following you into battle?
<name="robb"> Oh, I trust them with my life Just not with yours
<name="jaime"> Smart boy Whats wrong? Dont like being called boy’? Insulted?
<name="robb"> You insult yourself, Kingslayer Youve been defeated by a boy
<name="robb"> Youre held captive by a boy Perhaps youll be killed by a boy Stannis Baratheon sent ravens to all the high lords of Westeros King Joffrey Baratheon is neither a true king nor a true Baratheon Hes your bastard son
<name="jaime"> If thats true, Stannis is the rightful king How convenient for him
<name="robb"> My father learned the truth Thats why you had him executed
<name="jaime"> I was your prisoner when Ned Stark lost his head
<name="robb"> Your son killed him so the world wouldnt learn who fathered him And you you pushed my brother from a window because he saw you with the queen
<name="jaime"> You have proof? Or do you want to trade gossip like a couple of fishwives?
<name="robb"> Im sending one of your cousins down to Kings Landing with my peace terms
<name="jaime"> You think my fathers going to negotiate with you? You dont know him very well
<name="robb"> No, but hes starting to know me
<name="jaime"> Three victories dont make you a conqueror
<name="robb"> Its better than three defeats
<name="shae"> This city stinks Like dead bodies
<name="tyrion"> A bit corpsey, yes
<name="shae"> And shit
<name="tyrion"> I thought you wanted to come here
<name="shae"> I love it
<name="tyrion"> You love the smell of dead bodies and shit?
<name="shae"> And cum and garlic and rum
<name="tyrion"> You can smell cum from the balcony?
<name="shae"> I love the stink I love the noise Cities make me want to fuck
<name="tyrion"> And so did the country
<name="shae"> This is where I belong
<name="tyrion"> Yes, well, you need to be careful No one can know youre here
<name="shae"> No one will know
<name="tyrion"> You cant trust anyone in Kings Landing Theyre all liars; good liars, bad liars, one or two great liars
<name="shae"> What about you?
<name="tyrion"> Me? Im not from here Im a slave to the truth
<name="shae"> Truth? You are the biggest little liar I have ever met
<name="tyrion"> Why do you think I am so little? Im being, , crushed beneath the weight of all that truth
<name="tyrion"> Ned Stark actually slept on this, as if the poor man didnt suffer enough One of the many changes well have to make around here
<name="cersei"> Lord Baelish
<name="littlefinger"> Your Grace
<name="cersei"> I wonder if I might ask you for a favor
<name="littlefinger"> Of course, Your Grace
<name="cersei"> Ned Starks youngest daughter Arya we cant seem to locate her
<name="littlefinger"> If shes escaped the capital, Winterfell seems the logical destination
<name="cersei"> And yet my friends in the North report no sign of her
<name="littlefinger"> Curious
<name="cersei"> If we choose to negotiate with the Starks, the girl has some value Whoever finds her, well, you know what they say about Lannisters and debts
<name="littlefinger"> Well, you could ask Varys where she is Hell have an answer for you Whether you believe it,,, Myself, I have always had a hard time trusting eunuchs Who knows what they want?
<name="cersei"> A mockingbird You created your own Sigil, didnt you?
<name="littlefinger"> Yes
<name="cersei"> Appropriate for a self-made man with so many songs to sing
<name="littlefinger"> Im glad you like it Some people are fortunate enough to be born into the right family Others have to find their own way
<name="cersei"> I heard a song once about a boy of modest means who found his way into the home of a very prominent family He loved the eldest daughter Sadly, she had eyes for another
<name="littlefinger"> When boys and girls live in the same home, awkward situations can arise Sometimes, Ive heard, even brothers and sisters develop certain affections And when these affections become common knowledge, well, that is an awkward situation, indeed Especially in a prominent family But prominent families often forget a simple truth, Ive found
<name="cersei"> And which truth is that?
<name="littlefinger"> Knowledge is power
<name="cersei"> Seize him Cut his throat Stop Wait Ive changed my mind Let him go Step back three paces Turn around Close your eyes Power is power Do see if you can take some time away from your coins and your whores to locate the Stark girl for me I would very much appreciate it
<name="robb"> Youre Ser Alton Lannister?
<name="alton"> I am, Your Grace
<name="robb"> I offer your cousins peace if they meet my terms First, your family must release my sisters Second, my fathers bones must be returned to us so he may rest beside his brother and sister in the crypts beneath Winterfell And the remains of all those who died in his service must also be returned Their families can honor them with proper funerals
<name="alton"> An honorable request, Your Grace
<name="robb"> Third Joffrey and the Queen Regent must renounce all claim to dominion of the North From this time, till the end of time, we are a free and independent kingdom
<name="ser rodrik"> ing in the North THE OTHERS AT THE
<name="table"> King in the North
<name="robb"> Neither Joffrey nor any of his men shall set foot in our lands again If he disregards this command, he shall suffer the same fate as my father, only I dont need a servant to do my beheading for me
<name="alton"> These are Your Grace, these are.
<name="robb"> These are my terms If the Queen Regent and her son meet them, Ill give them peace If not, I will litter the south with Lannister dead
<name="alton"> King Joffrey is a Baratheon, Your Grace
<name="robb"> Oh, is he? Youll ride at daybreak, Ser Alton That will be all for tonight
<name="theon"> A word, Your Grace?
<name="robb"> You dont have to call me Your Grace’ when no ones around
<name="theon"> Its not so bad once you get used to it
<name="robb"> Im glad someones gotten used to it
<name="theon"> The Lannisters are going to reject your terms, you know?
<name="robb"> Of course they are
<name="theon"> We can fight them in the fields as long as you like, but we wont beat them until you take Kings Landing And we cant take Kings Landing without ships My father has ships and men who know how to sail them
<name="robb"> Men who fought my father
<name="theon"> Men who fought King Robert to free themselves from the yoke of the South, just like youre doing now Im his only living son Hell listen to me I know he will Im not a Stark I know that But your father raised me to be an honorable man We can avenge him together
<name="catelyn"> You dont want Balon Greyjoy for an ally
<name="robb"> I need his ships They say he has 200
<name="catelyn"> They say a million rats live in the sewers of Kings Landing Shall we rally them to fight for us?
<name="robb"> I understand you dont trust Lord Greyjoy
<name="catelyn"> I dont trust Lord Greyjoy because he is not trustworthy Your father had to go to war to end his rebellion
<name="robb"> Yes And now Im the one rebelling against the throne Before me, it was father You married one rebel and mothered another
<name="catelyn"> I mothered more than just rebels, a fact you seem to have forgotten
<name="robb"> If I trade the Kingslayer for two girls, my bannermen will string me up by my feet
<name="catelyn"> You want to leave Sansa in the Queens hands? And Arya, I havent heard a word about Arya What are we fighting for if not for them?
<name="robb"> Its more complicated than that! You know it is
<name="catelyn"> Its time for me to go home I havent seen Bran or Rickon in months
<name="robb"> You cant go to Winterfell
<name="catelyn"> I beg your pardon?
<name="robb"> Ill send Rodrik to watch over the boys, cause tomorrow, youll ride south to the Stormlands
<name="catelyn"> Why in the name of all the Gods
<name="robb"> Because I need you to negotiate with Renly Baratheon Hes rallied an army of 100,000 You know him You know his family
<name="catelyn"> I havent seen Renly Baratheon since he was a boy You have a hundred other lords
<name="robb"> Which of these lords do I trust more than you? If Renly sides with us, well outnumber them two to one When they feel the jaws beginning to shut, theyll sue for peace Well get the girls back Then well all go home for good
<name="catelyn"> I will ride at first light
<name="robb"> We will all be together again soon, I promise
<name="catelyn"> Youve done so well Your father would be proud
<name="robb"> Give Lord Renly my regards
<name="catelyn"> King Renly Theres a king in every corner now
<name="cersei"> What is all this?
<name="joffrey"> Returning this room to its proper appearance Say what you will about the Targaryens, they were conquerors That is a seat for a conqueror It needs a room to match it, not vines and flowers
<name="cersei"> We cant find Arya Stark
<name="joffrey"> With luck, shes dead in a ditch somewhere
<name="cersei"> Perhaps But if not, we need her Theyll never give Jaime back to us for Sansa alone
<name="joffrey"> I think they might Theyre weak They put too much value on their women
<name="cersei"> We need to set our armies to the task of finding her Send out as many men as we can Im sure if you asked grandfather
<name="joffrey"> ing does not ask; He commands And my grandfathers stupidity in the field of battle is the reason Robb Stark has Uncle Jaime in the first place
<name="cersei"> His life is in danger
<name="joffrey"> Were at war All our lives are in danger I heard a disgusting lie about Uncle Jaime And you
<name="cersei"> Our enemies will say anything to weaken your claim to the throne
<name="joffrey"> Its not a claim The throne is mine
<name="cersei"> Of course it is No one believes this foul gossip
<name="joffrey"> Someone believes it Father had other children? Besides me and Tommen and Myrcella?
<name="cersei"> What are you asking?
<name="joffrey"> Im asking if he fucked other women when he grew tired of you How many bastards does he have running
<name="joffrey"> What you just did is punishable by death You will never do it again Never That will be all, Mother

<name="jon"> Hes not a pet
<name="qhorin"> No, youre right, hes not You cant tame a wild thing You cant trust a wild thing
<name="jon"> Ghost is different
<name="qhorin"> So you think Wild creatures have their own rules, their own reasons And youll never know them Now the wildlings were looking for sleep during the day and hunt at night
<name="jon"> I thought you said you couldnt know wild things
<name="qhorin"> I said you cant They find a nice cave to hide in while the suns up and do their killing when its dark
<name="jon"> We could do the same
<name="qhorin"> No, we couldnt This is their country They know where to walk, where not to walk Ive lost good men who fell into a crevasse they didnt see till they were in it
<name="jon"> My father always said Im of the North
<name="jon"> I wasnt joking
<name="qhorin"> Look around, boy This look like home to you? You start thinking you know this place, it will kill you You understand me?
<name="qhorin"> No, you dont Were at war Weve always been at war Its never going to end cause were not fighting an enemy Were fighting the North, and its not going anywhere The Watch has given you a great gift You only have one thing to give in return, your life
<name="jon"> Ill gladly give my life
<name="qhorin"> I dont want you to be glad about it I want you to curse and fight until your hearts done pumping And know this, boy Your death will be a gift for them south of the Wall Theyll never know what youve done Theyll never know how you died They wont even know your damn name But theyll be alive because some nameless bastard north of the Wall gave his life for theirs Now, do you understand me?
<name="jon"> I do
<name="qhorin"> Youre even dumber than you look Its just words, boy, to keep us a little warmer in the night Make us feel like weve got a purpose Come on Weve got to find these goat fuckers before night falls and they find us
<name="tywin"> Can you read?
<name="amory"> My lord?
<name="tywin"> Can you read?
<name="tywin"> This letter detailing our infantry movements was meant for Lord Damon of House Marbrand It was sent to Lord Marlyn of House Dormand
<name="amory"> My apologies, my lord
<name="tywin"> Girl, fetch me the History of the Greater and the Lesser Houses Its the one on this
<name="tywin"> My cupbearer can read better than you
<name="tywin"> To whom does House Dormand owe allegiance?
<name="armory"> My lord
<name="tywin"> To the Starks of Winterfell! Who have 20,000 men and my son! I judged you might be good for something more than brutalizing peasants I see I overestimated you If you ever put my sons life at risk again, Ill Leave us
<name="tywin"> Put the book away, girl Maybe you should devise our next battle plan while youre about it
<name="guard"> Lord Petyr Baelish
<name="tywin"> Mmm Give us the room
<name="tywin"> Clear all this
<name="littlefinger"> Lord Tywin
<name="tywin"> Baelish
<name="tywin"> Wine?
<name="littlefinger"> Thank you
<name="tywin"> What news from the capital?
<name="littlefinger"> I traveled here directly from Renly Baratheons camp
<name="tywin"> Ah, the late King Renly Rather a short reign Murdered by a woman, I hear
<name="littlefinger"> So they say There has been talk of other forces at work Dark forces
<name="tywin"> Here Men love to blame demons when their grand plans unravel
<name="littlefinger"> It is my belief that a moment of chaos affords opportunities lost soon after
<name="tywin"> You say that as if you were the first man alive to think it Yes, a crisis is an opportunity What other brilliant insights have you brought me today?
<name="littlefinger"> After the Lannisters and the Starks, the Tyrells command the largest host Their lands are the most fertile in the Seven Kingdoms, feeding horses and soldiers
<name="tywin"> Yes, yes, yes
<name="littlefinger"> The Tyrells have not yet declared for any of the surviving kings Loras wants revenge He blames Stannis for Renlys death
<name="tywin"> Wants to be queen
<name="littlefinger"> Yes, she does
<name="tywin"> House Tyrell rebelled against the Iron Throne Against my grandson
<name="littlefinger"> They did And perhaps that treason should be punished one day, after Stannis and Robb Stark are defeated
<name="tywin"> More wine for Lord Baelish
<name="littlefinger"> If you will allow me to represent your familys interests, I believe that an advantageous agreement
<name="tywin"> The Tyrell host has returned to Highgarden?
<name="littlefinger"> They have
<name="arya"> Pardon, my lord
<name="littlefinger"> Its only wine
<name="tywin"> You would ride there yourself?
<name="littlefinger"> Tonight, with your leave
<name="tywin"> Ill have an answer by nightfall Thatll be all, girl
<name="tywin"> And what else?
<name="littlefinger"> On your son Tyrions directive, I met with Catelyn Stark
<name="tywin"> Why?
<name="littlefinger"> He had an interesting proposal for her concerning her daughters
<name="tywin"> Hmm
<name="jon"> A girl
<name="qhorin"> A wildling
<name="jon"> We could question her
<name="qhorin"> You could She wont answer Ive known a wildling to bite off his tongue instead of talking

<name="sandor"> The little birds bleeding Someone take her back to her cage See to that cut
<name="tyrion"> Well done, Clegane
<name="sandor"> I didnt do it for you
<name="daenerys"> He shouldnt make me wait
<name="xaro"> The Spice King is the second wealthiest man in Qarth He makes everyone wait Of course, you could have avoided this embarrassment if you married the wealthiest man in Qarth
<name="daenerys"> I already have a husband
<name="xaro"> Khal Drogo is gone, Khaleesi You are far too young to be a widow forever and far too beautiful
<name="daenerys"> And you are far too smart to think that I will succumb to flattery
<name="xaro"> I have traveled very far in my life and met many women, but none that are immune to flattery
<name="spice king"> The Mother of Dragons
<name="xaro"> Ah, here he comes
<name="spice king"> Forgive me I had terrible dreams last night Terrible dreams I could not sleep until the sun was shining and the birds were singing Look what a beauty you are now the Red Waste has been washed off you I am sorry about all that unpleasantness The silver hair of a true Targaryen Xaro Xhoan Daxos, she is far too lovely for a glorified dockworker like yourself
<name="xaro"> Very true, and yet they say that your grandfather, who sold pepper off the back of a wagon, married a lady far lovelier and higher born than himself
<name="spice king"> Every lady alive was lovelier and higher born than my grandfather Did my servants not offer you something to eat, to drink? Ill have them flogged in the square
<name="daenerys"> Thank you, my lord You are a gracious host, but there is no servant alive that can bring me what I want
<name="spice king"> Oh, she has a talent for drama, this one So, my little princess, what is it you want?
<name="daenerys"> My birthright The Seven Kingdoms of Westeros
<name="spice king"> I fear Im no better than a servant in this regard I cannot give you what I do not have
<name="daenerys"> Im not asking you for the kingdoms Im asking you for ships
<name="spice king"> I need to cross the Narrow Sea I need my ships as well I use them, you see, to bring spices from one port to another
<name="daenerys"> Whatever you grant me now will be repaid three times over when I retake the Iron Throne
<name="spice king"> Retake? Did you once sit on the Iron Throne?
<name="daenerys"> My father sat there, before he was murdered
<name="spice king"> But if you did not sit on it yourself, would it not be correct to say take the Iron Throne ?
<name="daenerys"> I didnt come here to argue grammar
<name="spice king"> Of course not You came to take my ships So let me explain my position, little princess Unlike you, I do not have exalted ancestors I make my living by trade And I judge every trade on its merits You ask for ships You say I shall be repaid triple I do not doubt your honesty or your intentions But before you repay your debts, you must seize the Seven Kingdoms Do you have an army?
<name="daenerys"> Not yet
<name="spice king"> You do not have an army Do you have powerful allies in Westeros?
<name="daenerys"> There are many there that support my claim
<name="spice king"> When were you there last?
<name="daenerys"> I left when I was a baby
<name="spice king"> So, in truth, you have no allies
<name="daenerys"> The people will rise to fight for their rightful queen when I return
<name="spice king"> Ah Forgive me, little princess, but I cannot make an investment based on wishes and dreams Now if youll pardon me
<name="daenerys"> Do you know lllyrio Mopatis, Magister of Pentos? Yes, weve met
<name="spice king"> A shrewd man
<name="daenerys"> For my wedding, he gave me three petrified dragon eggs He believed The world believed that the ages had turned them to stone How many centuries has it been since dragons roamed the skies? But I dreamt that if I carried those eggs into a great fire, they would hatch When I stepped into the fire, my own people thought I was mad But when the fire burned out, I was unhurt, the Mother of Dragons
<name="daenerys"> Do you understand? Im no ordinary woman My dreams come true
<name="spice king"> I admire your passion But in business, I trust in logic, not passion Im sorry, little princess
<name="daenerys"> I am not your little princess I am Daenerys Stormborn of the blood of Old Valyria, and I will take what is mine With fire and blood, I will take it
<name="spice king"> Yes, my lady, but not with my ships , catching her in the act
<name="tywin"> Who taught you to read?
<name="arya"> My father, my lord
<name="tywin"> Hmm I taught my son Jaime to read The maester came to me one day, told me he wasnt learning He couldnt make sense of the letters He reversed them in his head The maester said hed heard tell of this affliction and that we simply must accept it Ha! After that, I sat Jaime down for four hours every day until he learned He hated me for it, for a time For a long time But he learned Hmm Where is your father? Is he alive? Who was he?
<name="arya"> A stonemason
<name="twyin"> A stonemason who could read? Hmm
<name="arya"> He taught himself
<name="tywin"> Quite a man What killed him?
<name="arya"> Loyalty
<name="tywin"> Youre a sharp little thing, arent you?
<name="arya"> Did Forgive me, my lord I shouldnt ask questions
<name="tywin"> No But youve already begun
<name="arya"> Did you know your father, my lord?
<name="tywin"> I did I grew up with him I watched him grow old
<name="tywin"> He loved us He was a good man, but a weak man A weak man who nearly destroyed our house and name Im cold
<name="arya"> Ill fetch more wood for the fire, my lord
<name="tywin"> Mmm
<name="amory"> Where are you going, girl?
<name="arya"> The armory, my lord
<name="amory"> Why?
<name="arya"> Lord Tywin sent me
<name="amory"> What might this be?
<name="arya"> Lord Tywin gave it to me
<name="amory"> What for?
<name="arya"> To take to the armory
<name="amory"> Why would he do that? Lets go and ask him
<name="amory"> Move! Get out of the way
<name="arya"> Amory Lorch
<name="jaqen"> A girl has named a second name A man will do what must be done
<name="arya"> Now
<name="jaqen"> A girl cannot tell a man when exactly he must do a thing A man cannot make a thing happen before its time
<name="arya"> But hes going to tell Tywin Hes getting away It has to be now

<name="robb"> Im not sure Im a lady
<name="talisa"> Westerosi customs are still a bit foreign to me
<name="robb"> Its hard to keep all the rules straight But if I remember my lessons, a woman of noble birth is always called a lady Unless shes a queen or a princess I could find someone who knows
<name="talisa"> Why are you so sure Im of noble birth?
<name="robb"> Because its obvious
<name="talisa"> What if I told you my father sold lace on the Long Bridge, and my mother, my brother and I lived with him above our shop?
<name="robb"> Id call you a liar
<name="talisa"> Not very noble to accuse a lady of dishonesty
<name="talisa"> I always thought I was a brilliant liar
<name="robb"> Better at amputations, Im afraid
<name="robb"> Quite a pretty spot
<name="talisa"> Will we be here long?
<name="robb"> I couldnt really discuss troop movements with you
<name="talisa"> Im not a spy
<name="robb"> Of course, a spy would deny being a spy
<name="talisa"> Youre right Youve found me out Im writing a letter to the Lannisters The young wolf is on the move Perhaps youd join me If youve got time, of course, for

<name="jon"> We start again at first light Get some sleep
<name="jon"> Stop moving
<name="ygritte"> Im just trying to get comfortable
<name="jon"> Stop it
<name="jon"> Youre still moving
<name="ygritte"> Was I? I didnt notice that time
<name="robb"> This cannot be true
<name="roose"> Weve had ravens from White Harbor, Barrowton and the Dreadfort Im afraid it is true
<name="robb"> Why?
<name="why would theon roose"> Because the Greyjoys are treasonous whores
<name="robb"> My brothers?
<name="roose"> Weve heard nothing of them But Rodrik Cassel is dead
<name="catelyn"> I told you, never trust a Greyjoy
<name="robb"> I must go north at once
<name="roose"> Theres still a war to win, Your Grace
<name="robb"> How can I call myself king if I cant hold my own castle? How can I ask men to follow me if I cant
<name="roose"> You are a king And that means you dont have to do everything yourself
<name="catelyn"> Let me go and talk to Theon
<name="robb"> There will be no talk He will die for this
<name="roose"> Theon holds the castle with a skeleton crew Let me send word to my bastard at the Dreadfort He can raise a few hundred men and retake Winterfell before the new moon We have the Lannisters on the run If you march all the way back north now, youll lose what you gained My boy would be honored to bring you Prince Theons head
<name="robb"> Tell your son Bran and Rickons safety is paramount And Theon, I want him brought to me alive I want to look him in the eye and ask him why And then Ill take his head myself
<name="theon"> Why on earth would I trust the word of a lying little savage like you?
<name="osha"> Im no liar
<name="theon"> All wildlings are liars and savages with no loyalty to anything or anyone
<name="osha"> I done what I had to do to stay alive I hate the Starks as well as you do Let me serve you, my lord
<name="theon"> How? And dont tell me to put a spear in your hand
<name="osha"> There are other ways to serve, my lord
<name="theon"> Im a prince now, and youd do well
<name="ahsa"> There are other ways to serve, my prince
<name="theon"> Like what?
<name="osha"> We know things, the free people
<name="theon"> You know things? Like what? How to eat dirt?
<name="osha"> Other things
<name="osha"> Savage things
<name="theon"> Wait outside
<name="theon"> I always wondered what you had under there
<name="osha"> It comes at a price
<name="theon"> Im not killing you Thats your price
<name="osha"> I already had that
<name="theon"> What do you want then, other than your miserable life?
<name="ahsa"> What all free people want My freedom
<name="theon"> Well, you shall have it, then But only if you serve me well
<name="sansa"> Ow
<name="shae"> Shh Its not deep
<name="sansa"> I thought they were going to kill me
<name="shae"> They thought so, too
<name="sansa"> He hated me, the man who hit me I saw it in his eyes Hated me He never met me before, but he wanted to hurt me
<name="shae"> Of course he did
<name="sansa"> Why? Why would a stranger
<name="shae"> You are everything he will never have Your horse eats better than his children It doesnt matter now Hes dead
<name="sansa"> I would have given them bread if I had it I hate the king more than any of them
<name="shae"> Dont say these things If the wrong people hear you
<name="sansa"> But youre not the wrong people
<name="shae"> Dont trust anybody Life is safer that way
<name="guard"> And where are you going?
<name="osha"> I have something for you from Prince Theon
<name="guard"> What?
<name="osha"> Me He says Im to make the rounds And keep you warm
<name="daenerys"> The Spice King refuses me because Im a bad investment The Silk King wont support me because of his business with the Lannisters Why offend his best customer? And the Copper King offers me a single ship on the condition that I lie with him for a night Does he think I will whore myself for a boat?
<name="xaro"> When I came to this city, I had nothing Truly nothing I slept by the docks And when I could find work loading the ships, I would eat If not, I dreamed of food Today, I am the richest man in Qarth Do you think the path from poverty to wealth is always pure and honorable? I have done many things, Khaleesi, that a righteous man would condemn And here I am, with no regrets
<name="xaro"> Bar the gates Ring the bells Slowly, Khaleesi
<name="daenerys"> W h e r e a r e t h e y ? W h e r e a r e m y d r a g o n s ?

<name="man"> Riders approaching
<name="mar"> Open the gate
<name="yara"> Why, its the Prince of Winterfell
<name="theon"> Envy isnt attractive
<name="yara"> What envy?
<name="theon"> You should be proud of your brothers achievement I took the great castle of Winterfell with 20 men
<name="yara"> Youre a great warrior I saw the bodies above your gates Which one gave you the tougher fight, the cripple or the six-year-old?
<name="theon"> I treated the Stark boys with honor, and they repaid me with treachery
<name="yara"> You treated them with honor? By butchering them?
<name="theon"> Before I had to kill them, I treated them
<name="yara"> You seized their home, as is your right Were ironborn, we take what we need
<name="theon"> Exactly
<name="yara"> Then you made them prisoners in their home and they ran away Is that treachery? Id call it bravery
<name="theon"> They made me a promise
<name="yara"> Your little boy prisoners made you a promise and you got mad when they broke it? Are you the dumbest cunt alive?
<name="theon"> Dont call me
<name="yara"> A cunt A dumb cunt who killed the only two Starks in Winterfell You know how valuable those boys were?
<name="theon"> If I hadnt killed them, the Northerners would think me weak
<name="yara"> You are weak And youre stupid
<name="theon"> Im warning you
<name="yara"> Go on, then Warn me
<name="theon"> You havent brought enough men How am I supposed to defend Winterfell with just this lot?
<name="yara"> Youre not Ive come to bring you home Father wants a word
<name="theon"> Is this a joke? Winterfell is the heart of the North
<name="yara"> Aye, it is, hundreds of miles from the sea Were islanders, baby brother Had you forgotten that? Our power comes from our ships And now that youve decorated your walls with the bodies of the Stark boys, every man in the North wants to see you hanged When Robb Stark finds out
<name="theon"> He wont find out Weve killed all the ravens We have all the horses Ive taken Winterfell And I will keep Winterfell
<name="yara"> Leave us
<name="yara"> Theon, youre my blood We both loved our mother We both endured our father Come home with me Dont die here alone
<name="theon"> I dont intend to die
<name="yara"> You were a terrible baby, do you know that? Bawling all the time, never sleeping And one night, you just wouldnt shut up, screaming like a dying pig I walked over to your crib, I looked down at you I wanted to strangle you And you looked up at me and you stopped screaming You smiled at me Dont die so far from the sea
<name="ygritte"> Ive brought you a present, Lord of Bones
<name="lord of bones"> I already got one crow Dont need two
<name="ygritte"> Mance will want to question this one Knows all about where the crows are and what theyre planning
<name="lord of bones"> The Halfhand knows more This one is just a little boy Gut him
<name="ygritte"> He could have killed me half a dozen times
<name="lord of bones"> And now he wishes he did Gut him
<name="ygritte"> Hes a bastard of Winterfell, Ned Starks son Mance will want him
<name="lord of bones"> What does Mance want with a dead mans bastard?
<name="ygritte"> I dont know I think hell want to decide for himself
<name="lord of bones"> He runs, Ill chop his balls off
<name="ygritte"> He runs, Ill do it meself
<name="ygritte"> Were even now, Jon Snow
<name="jon"> I couldnt do it I had the sword on her neck
<name="i just couldnt qhorin"> I know
<name="jon"> The others?
<name="qhorin"> When you didnt come back, we went looking for you We found your tracks fast enough But they found us before we found you
<name="jon"> They died because of me
<name="qhorin"> See that it wasnt for nothing
<name="wildling"> All right, up, lad
<name="wildling"> Come on, on your feet, now Move it
<name="talisa"> Is she beautiful?
<name="robb"> Ive never met her
<name="talisa"> Whats her name?
<name="robb"> Frey, I suppose I dont know her first name
<name="talisa"> Im sure youll be very happy
<name="talisa"> And youre marrying her for a bridge?
<name="robb"> An important bridge
<name="talisa"> Ah
<name="robb"> It was before they killed my father I still thought I could march south and rescue him in time, but only if I crossed that bridge
<name="talisa"> When I speak to people from the North, they all loved your father
<name="robb"> He was the best man I ever met I know children always think that about their fathers
<name="but talisa"> Children do not always think that about their fathers, believe me
<name="robb"> He once told me that being a lord is like being a father, except you have thousands of children and you worry about all of them The farmers plowing the fields are yours to protect The charwomen scrubbing the floors, yours to protect The soldiers you order into battle He told me he woke with fear in the morning and went to bed with fear in the night I didnt believe him I asked him, How can a man be brave if hes afraid? That is the only time a man can be brave, he told me
<name="talisa"> I wish I could have met him
<name="robb"> He would have liked you
<name="talisa"> Most lords worry more about their gold and their glory than the charwomen scrubbing their floors
<name="robb"> He didnt care much about gold or glory
<name="talisa"> And you? You think Im fighting this war so theyll sing songs about me? I want to go home I want the men following me to go home
<name="talisa"> Then why dont you?
<name="robb"> Because well never be safe until the Lannisters are defeated And because I believe in justice
<name="talisa"> Chopping off Joffreys head, you mean
<name="robb"> That would be a start
<name="rider"> Your Grace, milady ingslayer, he escaped in the night
<name="robb"> How? How?
<name="robb"> Tell me this isnt true
<name="robb"> Why?
<name="catelyn"> For the girls
<name="robb"> You betrayed me
<name="robb robb"> No! You knew I would not allow it and you did it anyway
<name="catelyn"> Bran and Rickon are captives in Winterfell Sansa and Arya are captives in Kings Landing I have five children, and only one of them is free
<name="rickard kar"> I lost one son fighting by your sons side I lost another to the Kingslayer, strangled with a chain You commit treason because your children are prisoners? I would carve out my heart and offer it to the Father, if he would let my sons wake from their graves and step into a prison cell
<name="catelyn"> I grieve for your sons, my lord
<name="rickard kar"> I dont want your grief I want my vengeance And you stole it from me
<name="catelyn"> Killing Jaime Lannister would not buy life for your children, but returning him to Kings Landing may buy life for mine
<name="robb"> Jaime Lannister has played you for a fool Youve weakened our position Youve brought discord into our camp And you did it all behind my back Make sure shes guarded day and night
<name="catelyn"> Robb How many men did we send in pursuit of the Kingslayer?
<name="soldier"> Forty, Your Grace
<name="robb"> Send another 40 with our fastest horses
<name="catelyn"> Robb
<name="jaime"> Damn
<name="jaime"> Youre much uglier in daylight Whats your name? Im Jaime Lannister of Casterly Rock, son of Tywin
<name="jaime"> A captive knight has a right to know his captors identity
<name="brienne"> Brienne of Tarth
<name="jaime"> Tarth, Tarth, Tarth Crescent moons and starbursts Lord Selwyn Tarth Your father Do you have any brothers and sisters, my lady? Its a long way to Kings Landing Might as well get to know one another
<name="jaime"> Have you known many men? I suppose not Women? Horses? Ah
<name="jaime"> I didnt mean to give offense, my lady Forgive me
<name="brinenne"> Your crimes are past forgiveness, Kingslayer
<name="jaime"> Why do you hate me so much? Have I ever harmed you?
<name="brinenne"> Youve harmed others, those you were sworn to protect, the weak, the innocent
<name="jaime"> Has anyone ever told you youre as boring as you are ugly?
<name="brinenne"> You will not provoke me to anger
<name="jaime"> I already have Look at you Youre ready to chop my head off Do you think you could? Do you think you could beat me in a fair fight?
<name="brinenne"> Ive never seen you fight
<name="jaime"> The answer is no There are three men in the kingdoms who might have a chance against me Youre not one of them
<name="brienne"> All my life men like you have sneered at me And all my life Ive been knocking men like you into the dust
<name="jaime"> If youre so confident, unlock my chains Lets see what happens
<name="brinenne"> Do you take me for an idiot? In
<name="jaime"> I took you for a fighter, a man Pardon Woman of honor Was I wrong? Youre afraid
<name="brinenne"> Maybe one day well find out, Kingslayer
<name="kevan"> Kings Landing will fall an hour after Stannis lands his force Its not too late for King Joffrey and Cersei and the court to ride west to safety
<name="tywin"> Surrender the Iron Throne?
<name="kevan"> Better than seeing their heads mounted on the city gates Stannis will execute them all
<name="tywin"> No, a king who runs will not be king for long Hes a Lannister Hell stand and fight Stannis, two days from the capital and the wolf at my doorstep
<name="kevan"> The scouts assure us Robb Stark remains north of Ashemark
<name="tywin"> Ha! The last time the scouts assured us of Starks movement, he lured us into a trap Which is why my son is his prisoner
<name="twyin"> Too close to Casterly Rock
<name="kevan"> He sent a splinter force to recapture Winterfell The Greyjoys have done us a great favor Stark wont risk marching on Casterly Rock until hes at full force
<name="tywin"> Hes a boy and hes never lost a battle Hell risk anything at any time because he doesnt know enough to be afraid
<name="tywin"> Well ride at nightfall I want a full nights march before he knows were on the move Clegane, youll maintain a garrison here at Harrenhal Track down this brotherhood and destroy them The girl has proven herself a good servant Shell stay on with you See that he doesnt get drunk in the evenings Hes poor company when hes sober, but hes better at his work
<name="guard"> Youve got some questions to answer
<name="man"> Who killed Ser Amory?
<name="man"> I dont know! Please
<name="man"> Give me the name Take this one out for the crows
<name="man"> I told you, I dont know Please
<name="rorge"> Look, its Yorens little cunt Used to be a boy, now its a girl
<name="arya"> Wheres Jaqen?
<name="rorge"> Dont care Wheres your stick now, bitch? I promised to fuck you with it
<name="guard"> Come on, time to kill some wolves
<name="hot pie"> You need sour cherries to make it right And the secret is you dry the stones, and then you break them with a mallet Thats where the real flavor is You crush em up real fine And then when youre finished, you sprinkle them over the piecrust
<name="arya"> Wheres Jaqen?
<name="hot pie"> How would I know?
<name="arya"> I need him now Lord Tywins marching tonight
<name="gendry"> You need him?
<name="arya"> Hes helping me
<name="hot pie"> I saw him
<name="arya"> Where?
<name="arya"> Where?
<name="hot pie"> Ow
<name="arya"> Where?
<name="hot pie"> They went riding out the gates a few hours ago
<name="hot pie"> On patrol Let go of my ears
<name="hot pie"> What do you want with him anyway?
<name="quorin"> Mance is gonna march on the Wall When he does, one brother inside his army will be worth 1,000 fighting against it
<name="jon"> Theyll never trust me
<name="quorin"> They might If you do what needs to be done
<name="jon"> What?
<name="quorin"> How does it feel knowing those men all died so you could skip through the snow with your little savage girl?
<name="jon"> I didnt
<name="quorin"> I should have known better, trusting a traitors bastard
<name="lord of bones"> Hes not yours to kill, crow TYRION; Do you have to do that here?
<name="bronn"> I like to keep me hands clean
<name="tyrion"> Yes, but do you have to do it here?
<name="tyrion"> You should start wearing the gold cloak
<name="bronn"> I dont want to wear a gold cloak
<name="tyrion"> Youre commander of the City Watch You shouldnt be dressed like a common
<name="bronn"> A cloak slows you down in a fight Makes it hard to move quietly And the gold catches the light, so youre nice and easy to spot at night
<name="tyrion"> Well, youre not sneaking through alleyways any longer Youre supposed to stand out
<name="bronn"> We had a deal and wearing a gold cloak wasnt part of it
<name="tyrion"> Fine, fine No gold cloak
<name="tyrion"> What?
<name="bronn"> What?
<name="tyrion"> What? What? Why are you staring at me?
<name="bronn"> You dont want me cleaning me nails You dont want me looking your way Why am I here?
<name="tyrion"> To help me plan the defense of Kings Landing
<name="tyrion"> Stannis will be here any day
<name="bronn"> And one of these explains how to beat him?
<name="tyrion"> An History of the Great Sieges of Westeros By Archmaester Shevelathin Shevelatesh
<name="bronn"> Chevalteesh Id swap all your books for a few good archers
<name="varys"> My Lord Hand Commander I must compliment you on the gold cloaks performance these last few weeks Did you know there has been a marked drop in thievery?
<name="tyrion"> I did not know And how did you accomplish this marked drop in thievery?
<name="bronn"> Me and the lads rounded up all the known thieves
<name="tyrion"> For questioning?
<name="bronn"> No Its just the unknown thieves we need to worry about now
<name="tyrion"> We talked about this
<name="bronn"> Aye, we talked about it Have you ever been in a city under siege? Maybe this parts not in your books See, its not the fighting that kills most people Its the starving Foods worth more than gold Noble ladies sell their diamonds for a sack of potatoes Things get bad enough, the poor start eating each other
<name="bronn"> The thieves, they love a siege Soon as the gates are sealed, they steal all the food By the time its all over, theyre the richest men in town
<name="varys"> Given the circumstances, my lord, I believe extreme measures are warranted
<name="varys"> Ah The Great Sieges of Westeros Thrilling subject Shame Archmaester ChVyalthan wasnt a better writer
<name="tyrion"> Stannis knows Kings Landing He knows where the walls are strongest, and he knows which gates are weakest The Mud Gate A good ram will batter it down in minutes, and its only 50 yards from the water Thats where hell land
<name="varys"> And if Stannis does attack the Mud Gate, what is our plan?
<name="bronn"> We could throw books at his men
<name="varys"> We dont have that many books
<name="bronn"> We dont have that many men, either
<name="varys"> What do we have?
<name="tyrion"> Pig shit
<name="sam"> Im not cut out for this sort of work
<name="eddison"> I always imagined meself doing something much worse
<name="grenn"> Were digging latrine pits at the end of the world I cant imagine anything much worse
<name="eddison"> You lack imagination
<name="sam"> Where do you think Jon is right now?
<name="eddision"> He went off with the Halfhand He didnt come back A betting man would go with dead
<name="sam"> Hes not dead No, Jons a great fighter
<name="grenn"> Well, hes better than me and a lot better than you
<name="sam"> Hes got a Valyrian steel sword
<name="eddision"> So did his father
<name="sam"> And Qhorin Halfhand is the greatest ranger alive
<name="eddison"> Great rangers never get old is the problem Shit ones neither Its them in the middle that last a long time
<name="grenn"> What in seven hells is that?
<name="sam"> The First Men made these marks Help me with it
<name="grenn"> Look
<name="eddision"> If you find something youre not supposed to, best thing to do is pretend youve never seen it
<name="sam"> Thats a Nights Watch cloak
<name="grenn"> Its been here a long time
<name="sam"> Oh Must be dragonglass
<name="grenn"> Dragonglass?
<name="sam"> The maesters call it obsidian
<name="grenn"> Why would a brother hide it here?
<name="eddison"> I expect its cause he wanted somebody to find it
<name="soldier"> Mind where youre going
<name="arya"> Im sorry
<name="ill arya"> Where were you?
<name="jaqen"> A man has patrol duty
<name="arya"> Tywin Lannister was right here, and now hes gone
<name="jaqen"> A girl owes one more name The Red God demands it Give the man a name
<name="arya"> How long after I give you the name does it take you to kill someone?
<name="jaqen"> A minute, an hour, a month Death is certain, the time is not
<name="arya"> Hes taking his army to attack my brother I need him dead right now
<name="jaqen"> This a man cannot do
<name="arya"> You promised youd help me
<name="jaqen"> Help was not promised, lovely girl Only death There must be others Give a name, any name
<name="arya"> And youll kill them? Anybody?
<name="jaqen"> By the Seven New Gods and the Old Gods beyond counting, I swear it
<name="arya"> All right Jaqen Hghar
<name="jaqen"> A girl gives a man his own name?
<name="arya"> Thats right
<name="jaqen"> Gods are not mocked This is no joking thing
<name="arya"> Im not joking A man can go kill himself
<name="jaqen"> Un-name me
<name="arya"> No
<name="jaqen"> Please?
<name="arya"> Ill un-name you
<name="jaqen"> Thank you
<name="arya"> If you help me and my friends escape
<name="jaqen"> This would require more than one life This is not part of our bargain
<name="arya"> Fine, Jaqen Hghar
<name="jaqen"> A girl lacks honor If I do this thing, a girl must obey
<name="arya"> A girl will obey
<name="jaqen"> A girl and her friends will walk through the gate at midnight
<name="tyrion"> Thank you, Podrick
<name="cersei"> Odd little boy
<name="tyrion"> I have a certain sympathy for odd little boys
<name="cersei"> You and Varys both
<name="tyrion"> Excellent lamprey pie Were you slaving away in the kitchen all day? I hear Joffrey plans on fighting An inspiration for the troops The young king in his shining armor fighting to defend the capital against the wicked old rebel
<name="cersei"> Hes only a boy
<name="tyrion"> Younger boys are off fighting his war
<name="cersei"> Hes not ready
<name="tyrion"> What is he, 17? Remember Jaime at 17?
<name="cersei"> Better than you Some men have a gift for this sort of thing, some dont His place is not on the battlefield
<name="tyrion"> Its not on the throne, either, sadly for all of us
<name="cersei"> Do you think Im an idiot?
<name="tyrion"> No, Id say you possess above-average intelligence
<name="cersei"> You shipped off my only daughter And now you want to send my eldest son to the battlefield to die
<name="tyrion"> Hell have his Kingsguard protecting him He has the finest armor gold can buy He needs to be out there The men will fight more fiercely seeing their king fighting beside them instead of hiding behind his mothers skirts Any dessert?
<name="cersei"> Do you know why Varys is so dangerous?
<name="tyrion"> Because he has thousands of spies in his employ Because he knows everything we do before we do it
<name="cersei"> Because he doesnt have a cock
<name="tyrion"> Neither do you
<name="cersei"> Perhaps Im dangerous, too You, on the other hand, are as big a fool as every other man That little worm between your legs does half your thinking
<name="tyrion"> Its not that little
<name="tyrion"> Why are you smiling?
<name="cersei"> Because Im happy
<name="tyrion"> And why are you happy?
<name="cersei"> Because I have your little whore
<name="tyrion"> I thought you preferred blondes
<name="cersei"> Such a droll little fellow Tell me, have you married this one yet? No? Good Father will be so pleased
<name="tyrion"> Why do you care who I fuck?
<name="cersei"> Because a Lannister always pays her debts You stole my only daughter, you plot to have Joffrey killed
<name="tyrion"> This is madness Stannis will be here in days You need me
<name="cersei"> For what? Your skill in battle? Pretty thing, your whore Lovely body The bruises will heal in time
<name="tyrion"> Where did you find her?
<name="cersei"> Varys isnt the only one who hears whispers Really, a Lannister lion necklace? You need to hide your secret whores more carefully
<name="tyrion"> Youve forgotten the most important thing about whores
<name="cersei"> Oh? Well, youre the expert Tell me
<name="tyrion"> You dont buy them, you only rent them
<name="cersei"> Youre usually a better liar, baby brother This one you like You like her very much Could it be love? Dont worry, shell be treated gently enough Unless Joffrey is hurt And then every wound he suffers, shell suffer, too And if he dies, there isnt a man alive who could devise a more painful death for your little cunt
<name="tyrion"> And how do I know you havent killed her already?
<name="cersei"> Would you like to see her? I thought you might Ser Mandon, bring in my brothers whore
<name="tyrion"> Im sorry they hurt you You must be brave
<name="tyrion"> I promise I will free you
<name="whore"> Dont forget me
<name="tyrion"> Never
<name="tyrion"> I will hurt you for this A day will come when you think youre safe and happy, and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth And you will know the debt is paid
<name="cersei"> Get out
<name="tyrion"> Shae
<name="shae"> Ive been waiting all night What is wrong?
<name="tyrion"> Youre beautiful
<name="shae"> Then why do you look sad?
<name="tyrion"> We have to be more careful
<name="shae"> Dont be afraid I can take care of myself
<name="tyrion"> There are people who want to hurt me
<name="shae"> I know I wont let them Ill cut off their faces I will
<name="tyrion"> I would kill for you Do you know that? I expect Ill have to before this is over Youre mine
<name="shae"> Im yours
<name="tyrion"> Promise me
<name="shae"> Im yours, and you are mine
<name="robb"> Still no word?
<name="roose"> Weve sent a dozen ravens None have returned My bastard is only a few days from Winterfell Once he captures the castle
<name="robb"> Theon has my brothers If we storm the castle
<name="roose"> He wouldnt dare hurt the boys Theyre his only hope of escaping the North with his head
<name="robb"> Send word to your son Any ironborn who surrender will be allowed to return safely to their homes
<name="roose"> A touch of mercy is a virtue, Your Grace
<name="too much robb"> Any ironborn with the exception of Theon Greyjoy He betrayed our cause He betrayed me And we will hunt him down no matter where he runs
<name="roose"> I expect his countrymen will turn on him the minute they hear the offer
<name="talisa"> Your pardon, my lord Your Grace
<name="roose"> My lady
<name="talisa"> How are you?
<name="robb"> How am I? Ive had to arrest my mother The Lannisters have my sisters The man I considered my closest friend has seized my home and my brothers Im fighting a war and I dont know if I should march south or north
<name="talisa"> Im sorry It was a stupid question Im sorry
<name="robb"> No Forgive me Youre being kind I have no right
<name="talisa"> You have every right Youre a king
<name="robb"> Thats not the kind of king I want to be
<name="talisa"> What kind do you want to be?
<name="robb"> I dont know The good kind Most kings grew up as princes They spend their whole lives preparing for the crown I was raised to be Lord of Winterfell
<name="talisa"> I was raised to be a proper little lady, to play the harp and dance the latest steps and recite Valyrian poetry
<name="robb"> Id like to hear you play the harp
<name="talisa"> No No, you would not
<name="robb"> How did you go from reciting Valyrian poetry to sawing off mens feet?
<name="talisa"> When I was 12, my mother and father went to a wedding Weddings in Volantis last for days, you know And they left me with my little brother The second afternoon they were gone was the hottest day in the three-year summer We couldnt bear to be inside, so we ran down to the Rhoyne Every child in Volantis was in the Rhoyne that day The rich, the poor, we were all there Naked, screaming, racing to the little islands Drummers were playing for coppers on the east bank I was treading water, talking to a friend, when I realized I hadnt seen my brother I called his name Then I started screaming his name And then I saw him floating face down My heart just stopped I was I dragged him from the water My friend helped me, I think I dont even remember He was so little Then we pulled him onto the riverbank And I screamed at him and I shook him And he was dead Just dead A man ran over He had a fish tattoo on his face In Volantis, the slaves have tattoos So you know what they are without having to talk to them And this man worked on a fishing boat And he pushed me out of the way You have to understand, for a slave to push a highborn girl, thats death for the man, a terrible death But he pushed me out of the way, and he started pressing on my brothers chest again and again and again, until my brother spat out half of the Rhoyne and cried out And the man cradled his head and told him to be calm I decided two things that day I would not waste my years planning dances and masquerades with the other noble ladies And when I came of age, I would never live in a slave city again Im sorry, Your Grace You told me of your problems and Ive blathered on
<name="robb"> I dont want to marry the Frey girl
<name="talisa"> I dont want you to marry her
<name="robb"> But you needed that bridge I hope its a very beautiful bridge
<name="hot pie"> The sour cherries was all crushed up and ready
<name="gendry"> Shut up
<name="hot pie"> Probably in the piecrust by now In the oven The nice, warm oven
<name="ayra"> Shut up What did you bring?
<name="hot pie"> The cheese could be better I did get some nice sausages GENDRY What did he want us to do about those guards?
<name="arya"> He didnt say He just said, Walk through the gates
<name="gendry"> What about the guards?
<name="arya"> He didnt say anything about the guards
<name="gendry"> What, he left that bit out? Its a pretty important part, dont you think?
<name="arya"> We have to trust him
<name="gendry"> Trust him? You trusted him to fight with us when you set him free and he ran
<name="hot pie"> I want to go back to the kitchens
<name="arya"> Shut up Stay here if youre afraid
<name="gendry"> Arry, dont
<name="man"> Away! Reset
<name="davos"> If the wind holds, well reach Kings Landing in a day
<name="stannis"> Will it hold?
<name="davos"> Cant make promises for the wind, Your Grace
<name="man"> Again, pull
<name="stannis"> I admire you, Ser Davos
<name="davos"> I thank you, Your Grace
<name="stannis"> Pleased to hear it Some highborn fools call you Onion Knight and think they insult you So you take the onion for your sigil, sew it on your coat, fly the onion flag
<name="davos"> My son wishes me to change it Three mermen with tridents, something like that I understand why the older families look down at me
<name="stannis"> Do you? Why?
<name="davos"> My father was a crabber
<name="stannis"> And?
<name="davos"> Well, sons of lords dont like to break bread with sons of crabbers Our hands stink
<name="stannis"> And where were those lords when Storms End starved?
<name="davos"> Many fought bravely for your brother Many fought for the Mad King
<name="stannis"> You defend these men who insult you behind your back
<name="davos"> Some are happy to do it to my face
<name="stannis"> We were forgotten Robert and Ned Stark, they were the heroes The glorious rebels marching from battle to battle, liberating towns from the yoke of the Mad King, while I held Storms End with 500 men
<name="davos"> No one has forgotten, Your Grace
<name="stannis"> No? Robert did He gave Storms End to Renly after the war Renly never fought a day in his life
<name="davos"> He was only a boy
<name="stannis"> Then whyd he give him Storms End?
<name="stannis"> First, we ate the horses We werent riding anywhere, not with the castle surrounded We couldnt feed them, so fine, the horses Then the cats Never liked cats So fine I do like dogs Good animals Loyal But we ate them Then the rats The night before you slipped through, I thought my wife was dying She couldnt speak anymore, she was so frail And then you made it through the lines Slipped right through in your little black sailboat with your onions
<name="davos"> And potatoes Some salted beef, I believe
<name="stannis"> Every man in Storms End wanted to kiss you that night
<name="davos"> I was relieved they did not
<name="stannis"> Robert told me to hold Storms End, so I held it Then he told me he was giving it to Renly, so I gave it up Insult or no, I gave it up Because Robert was my older brother, and he was the king and Ive always done my duty But now, Im the rightful king by every law of Westeros And when I sit the Iron Throne, youll be my Hand
<name="davos"> Your Grace, I pray I serve you well
<name="stannis"> I expect youll be the first crabbers son to wear the badge
<name="joffrey"> Youre the Master of Whisperers Youre supposed to know everything
<name="varys"> No man can be in all rooms at all times I have many little birds in the North, my lord, but I havent heard their songs since Theon Greyjoy captured Winterfell
<name="joffrey"> The Stark forces are distracted Now is the time to strike
<name="tyrion"> To strike? My dear nephew, you do see these men preparing the walls for siege? You do understand Stannis Baratheon sails this way?
<name="joffrey"> If my Uncle Stannis lands on the shores of Kings Landing, Ill ride out to greet him
<name="tyrion"> A brave choice, Your Grace Im sure your men will line up behind you
<name="joffrey"> They say Stannis never smiles Ill give him a red smile from ear to ear
<name="tyrion"> Imagine Stannis terror
<name="varys"> I am trying
<name="tyrion"> Youre an intelligent man Id like to think Im an intelligent man
<name="varys"> Oh, no one disputes that, my lord, not even the multitudes who despise you
<name="tyrion"> I wish we could converse as two honest, intelligent men
<name="varys"> I wish we could, too
<name="tyrion"> What do you want? Tell me
<name="varys"> If were going to play, youll have to start
<name="tyrion"> My brother was the youngest Kingsguard in history My sister became queen at the age of 19 When I reached manhood, my father put me in charge of all the drains and cisterns in Casterly Rock
<name="varys"> A most highborn plumber
<name="tyrion"> The water never flowed better And all the shit found its way to the sea I never expected to have any real power So when my father named me acting Hand
<name="varys"> Youre quite good at being Hand, you know? Jon Arryn and Ned Stark were good men Honorable men But they disdained the game and those who played You enjoy the game
<name="tyrion"> I do Last thing I expected
<name="varys"> And you play it well
<name="tyrion"> Id like to keep playing it If Stannis breaches the gates, the game is over
<name="varys"> They say he burns his enemies alive to honor the Lord of Light
<name="tyrion"> The Lord of Light wants his enemies burned, the Drowned God wants them drowned Why are all the gods such vicious cunts? Where is the god of tits and wine?
<name="varys"> In the Summer Isles, they worship a fertility goddess with 16 teats
<name="tyrion"> We should sail there immediately
<name="varys"> This morning, I heard a song all the way from Qarth beyond the Red Waste Daenerys Targaryen lives
<name="tyrion"> A girl at the edge of the world is the least of our problems
<name="varys"> She has three dragons But even if what they say is true, itll be years before they are fully grown And then there will be nowhere to hide
<name="tyrion"> One game at a time, my friend
<name="jorah"> Careful, Khaleesi Xaro owns this city and the warlocks have a thousand eyes watching for you I found one A ship with a good captain She leaves for Astapor tomorrow
<name="daenerys"> Astapor?
<name="jorah"> We cannot stay here
<name="daenerys"> They have my dragons A mother does not flee without her children
<name="jorah"> Theyre not your children I know they call you the Mother of Dragons and I know you love them, but you didnt grow them in your womb They didnt suckle at your breast They are dragons, Khaleesi And if we stay in Qarth, well die
<name="daenerys"> You should sail to Astapor Im sure youll be safe there
<name="jorah"> You know I would die for you I will never abandon you Im sworn to protect you, to serve
<name="daenerys"> Then serve me If my dragons are in the House of the Undying, then take me there
<name="jorah"> Thats what the warlock wants He told you so himself If you enter that place, you will never leave again His magic is strong
<name="daenerys"> And what of my magic? You saw me step into the fire You watched the witch burn What did the flames do to me? Do you remember?
<name="jorah"> Until my last breath, I will remember After I have forgotten my mothers face
<name="daenerys"> They are my children And they are the only children I will ever have Take me to them
<name="theon"> We should bury them
<name="dagmer"> Id leave em up a few more days Sends a message
<name="theon"> If they havent got the damn message yet, a few more days wont help As you say But it dont hurt to let em rot a while longer
<name="dagmer"> Whats this?
<name="theon"> Gold for the farmer For his trouble
<name="dagmer"> His troubles are done Hes feeding the crops now
<name="dagmer"> His wife, too You want to keep a man silent, you silence him
<name="osha"> Got as far as the farm and then doubled back Walked through the stream to throw off the hounds Hoped this would be the last place theyd think to look
<name="luwin"> Youre right so far
<name="osha"> Who was that out there hung up at the gates?
<name="luwin"> Must have been the farmers boys
<name="osha"> He killed them and burned them and passed them off as the little lords?
<name="luwin"> They mustnt know Bran would blame himself

<name="tyrion"> Pod! Find Bronn or Varys Tell them I am here with Maester Pycelle Tell them I am very much alive
<name="podrick"> Yes, my lord
<name="pycelle"> Would you like something for the pain?
<name="tyrion"> What happened?
<name="pycelle"> The murderer and traitor Stannis Baratheon suffered a stunning defeat at the hands of your father
<name="tyrion"> Where am I?
<name="pycelle"> These are your new chambers A little cramped, perhaps, but you dont need much room, do you? You are no longer Hand of the King
<name="pycelle"> Oh, For your trouble
<name="joffrey"> I, Joffrey of the House Baratheon, first of my name, the rightful King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, do hereby proclaim my grandfather, Tywin Lannister, the savior of the city and the Hand of the King
<name="tywin"> Thank you, Your Grace
<name="joffrey"> Lord Petyr Baelish, step forward
<name="joffrey"> For your good service and ingenuity in uniting the Houses of Lannister and Tyrell, I declare that you shall be granted the castle of Harrenhal with all its attendant lands and incomes to be held by your sons and grandsons from this day until the end of time
<name="littlefinger"> You honor me beyond words, Your Grace I shall have to acquire some sons and grandsons
<name="the crowd laughs joffrey"> Ser Loras Tyrell
<name="jofffrey"> Your house has come to our aid The whole realm is in your debt, none more so than I If your family would ask anything of me, ask it, and it shall be yours
<name="loras"> Your Grace, my sister Margaery, her husband was taken from us before She remains innocent I would ask you to find it in your heart to do us the great honor of joining our houses
<name="joffrey"> Is this what you want, Lady Margaery?
<name="margaery"> With all my heart, Your Grace I have come to love you from afar Tales of your courage and wisdom have never been far from my ears And those tales have taken root deep inside of me
<name="joffrey"> I, too, have heard tales of your beauty and grace, but the tales do not do you justice, my lady It would be an honor to return your love, but I am promised to another A king must keep his word
<name="cersei"> Your Grace, in the judgment of your Small Council, it would be neither proper nor wise for you to wed the daughter of a man beheaded for treason, a girl whose brother is in open rebellion against the throne as we speak For the good of the realm, your councilors beg you to set Sansa Stark aside
<name="crowd"> Margaery! We want Margaery
<name="joffrey"> I would like to heed your wishes and the wishes of my people, but I took a holy vow
<name="pycelle"> Your Grace, the gods do indeed hold betrothal solemn, but your father, blessed be his memory, made this pact before the Starks revealed their falseness I have consulted with the High Septon and he assures me that their crimes against the realm free you from any promise you have made to them in the sight of the gods
<name="joffrey"> The gods are good I am free to heed my heart Ser Loras, I will gladly wed your sweet sister You will be my queen and I will love you from this day until my last day
<name="littlefinger"> My lady My sincerest condolences

<name="varys"> No need for that, my dear
<name="ros"> You sure? Most men like what they see
<name="varys"> Im not like most men
<name="ros"> Thats what most men say
<name="ros"> If you dont want what most men want, then youd better tell me what youd like me to do
<name="varys"> I would like you to tell me if working for Lord Baelish has been all youd hoped it would be
<name="ros"> Have we met?
<name="varys"> You wouldnt remember me if we had?
<name="ros"> I meet a lot of men
<name="varys"> And I think you remember all of them I think your true talents are wasted on them
<name="ros"> Youre very kind, my lord Allow me to return the favor
<name="varys"> Youre afraid Why? Nothing dangerous down there
<name="ros"> I know who you are

<name="ros"> How do you know about that?
<name="varys"> I thought you said you knew who I was
<name="ros"> What can I do for you, Lord Varys?

<name="jaime"> I wish someone had told me I wouldnt have had to steal that pig
<name="brienne"> If this is the Kingslayer, I think Id know about it
<name="man"> How do you know what the Kingslayer looks like?
<name="man"> I was at Whispering Wood I saw him They dragged him out of the woods and threw him down before the king
<name="brienne"> Hes not the Kingslayer Sorry to disappoint you If he was, Id only be traveling his head
<name="man"> I have a question for you both And I want you to answer it at the same time I count to three, you both answer Whats his name? One Two Three

<name="catelyn"> Walder Frey is a dangerous man to cross
<name="robb"> I know that
<name="catelyn"> And you mean to do it anyway?
<name="robb"> I love her
<name="catelyn"> I know that seems important to you
<name="robb"> It is important to me
<name="catelyn"> Your father didnt love me when we married He hardly knew me or I him Love didnt just happen to us We built it slowly over the years, stone by stone, for you, for your brothers and sisters, for all of us Its not as exciting as secret passion in the woods, but it is stronger It lasts longer
<name="robb"> And that is what would be in store for me with one of Walder Freys daughters, what you and father had?
<name="catelyn"> Why not? Because shes not beautiful? Because shes not exotic and exciting?
<name="robb"> Now youre arguing just to argue because you arranged it
<name="catelyn"> And you agreed to it You gave him your word Treat your oaths recklessly, and your people will do the same If your father lived his life for one thing
<name="robb"> My father is dead And the only parent I have left has no right to call anyone reckless
<name="stannis"> You said you saw my victory in the flames
<name="melisandre"> l I did I still see it
<name="stannis"> The flames lied And Im no better than a savage trusting in a fire god I fought for your god in Blackwater Bay I led my men to the gates of the seventh hell as their brothers burned alive, and for what? Attacked from behind by Tywin Lannister and the Tyrells If you see so much in your flames, why didnt you warn me?
<name="melisandre"> The Lord of Light only allows me glimpses
<name="stannis"> You claimed to speak for a god
<name="melisandre"> Will you quit the war just because youve lost a battle?
<name="stannis"> You talk about war as if you understand it
<name="melisandre"> Ive been fighting far longer than you
<name="stannis"> Have you? Show me how you fight
<name="stannis"> Show me
<name="stannis"> Wheres your god now? Will he save you? Where is your god?
<name="melisandre"> Inside you
<name="stannis"> I murdered my brother
<name="melisandre"> We murdered him Share the weight with me
<name="stannis"> He wasnt your brother
<name="melisandre"> This war has just begun It will last for years Thousands will die at your command You will betray the men serving you You will betray your family You will betray everything you once held dear And it will all be worth it because you are the Son of Fire You are the Warrior of Light You will sweep aside this pretender and that one You will be king
<name="stannis"> You promise these things, but you dont know None of us know
<name="melisandre"> Let me show you
<name="melisandre"> Look into the fire, my king Look
<name="stannis"> I see fire
<name="melisandre"> Keep looking Do you see? Do you see, my king?
<name="stannis"> Yes
<name="theon"> I will kill that man I dont care how many arrows they feather me with, how many spears they run through me, I will kill that horn-blowing cunt before I fall
<name="luwin"> They want you to know youre surrounded
<name="theon"> I know Im surrounded I know that because I stood on the battlements and saw I was surrounded
<name="luwin"> They dont want you to sleep They want to sap your spirit before
<name="theon"> Thank you, wise bald man Thank you for explaining siege tactics to me
<name="theon"> No word from my father?
<name="luwin"> No
<name="theon"> Send more ravens
<name="luwin"> You killed all the ravens
<name="theon"> The first time I saw Winterfell
<name="theon"> First time I saw Winterfell, it looked like something that had been here for thousands of years and would be here for thousands of years after I was dead I saw it and I thought, Of course, Ned Stark crushed our rebellion and killed my brothers We never stood a chance against the man who lives here
<name="luwin"> Lord Stark went out of his way to make it your home
<name="theon"> Yes, my captors were so very kind to me You love reminding me of that Everyone in this frozen pile of shit has always loved reminding me of that You know what its like to be told how lucky you are to be someones prisoner? To be told how much you owe them? And then to go back home to your real father
<name="theon"> I will kill that man I swear to the Drowned God, the Old Gods, the New Gods, to every fucking god in every fucking heaven, I will kill that man
<name="luwin"> Theon, listen to me I serve Winterfell Now Winterfell is yours Im bound by oath to serve you
<name="theon"> And whats your counsel, trusted friend?
<name="luwin"> Run
<name="luwin"> Five hundred Northmen wait outside the walls You have 20 men You cant win Wait for nightfall and run
<name="theon"> Theres nowhere to run Id never make it back to the Iron Islands And even if I did, even if by some miracle I slipped through the lines and made it home, Id be a coward The Greyjoy who ran The shame of the family
<name="luwin"> Dont go home Join the Nights Watch
<name="luwin"> Once a man has taken the black, hes beyond reach of the law All his past crimes are forgiven
<name="theon"> I wont make it to the Wall I wont make it 10 feet past the Winterfell gates
<name="luwin"> There are ways Hidden passageways built so the Lords of Winterfell could escape The road will be dangerous But with a little luck.
<name="luwin"> The Nights Watch is an ancient, honorable order Youll have opportunities there
<name="theon"> The opportunity for Jon Snow to cut my throat in my sleep
<name="luwin"> The opportunity to make amends for what youve done
<name="theon"> Ive done a lot, havent I? Things I never imagined myself doing
<name="luwin"> Ive known you many years, Theon Greyjoy Youre not the man youre pretending to be Not yet
<name="theon"> You may be right But Ive gone too far to pretend to be anything else
<name="theon"> You hear that? Thats the mating call of the Northmen They want to fuck us Well, I havent had a good fuck in weeks Im ready for one
<name="theon"> They say every ironborn man is worth a dozen from the mainland
<name="men"> Aye
<name="theon"> You think theyre right?
<name="black lorren"> Aye
<name="theon"> We die today, brothers We die bleeding from 100 wounds with arrows in our necks and spears in our guts, but our war cries will echo through eternity They will sing about the battle of Winterfell until the Iron Islands have slipped beneath the waves Every man, woman and child will know who we were and how long we stood Aggar and Gelmarr, Wex and Urzen, Stygg and Black Lorren Ironborn warriors will cry out our names as they leap onto the shores of Seagard and Faircastle
<name="men"> Aye
<name="theon"> Mothers will name their sons for us
<name="men"> Aye
<name="theon"> Girls will think of us with their lovers inside them
<name="men"> Aye
<name="theon"> And whoever kills that fucking horn-blower will stand in bronze above the shores of Pyke
<name="men"> Aye
<name="theon"> What is dead may never die
<name="men"> What is dead may never die
<name="black lorren"> Thought hed never shut up
<name="dagmer"> It was a good speech Didnt want to interrupt
<name="luwin"> What is this? What are you doing?
<name="dagmer"> Lets go home
<name="man"> Come on
<name="tyrion"> Why should I believe you?
<name="varys"> Why would I lie about it?
<name="tyrion"> To create strife between my sister and me
<name="varys"> Where before there was nothing but love Ser Mandon Moore tried to kill you on your sisters orders If it werent for your squires bravery, youd be a dead man
<name="tyrion"> Pod
<name="podrick"> Yes, my lord?
<name="tyrion"> Would it be excessive of me to ask you to save my life twice in a week?
<name="podrick"> No, my lord
<name="tyrion"> Youre a good lad Get Bronn, tell him I want four of his most loyal gold cloaks outside my door at all times
<name="varys"> Im afraid your friend has been relieved of his command of the City Watch The gold cloaks are now firmly in the hands of your father or your sister It varies from cloak to cloak
<name="tyrion"> Then my hill tribesmen
<name="varys"> Have gone home Your father paid them quite handsomely Im afraid we wont be seeing each other for some time, my lord
<name="tyrion"> Dont want to swim too close to a drowning man? And I thought we were friends
<name="varys"> We are Podrick, would you mind?
<name="varys"> There are many who know that without you this city faced certain defeat The king wont give you any honors, the histories wont mention you, but we will not forget
<name="varys"> Come along now, Podrick
<name="shae"> My love
<name="tyrion"> It was good of you to come
<name="shae"> Good of me? Of course I come
<name="shae"> I want to see you
<name="tyrion"> Believe me, you dont
<name="shae"> Have you looked?
<name="shae"> I will be the first
<name="tyrion"> Well?
<name="shae"> You are a mess
<name="tyrion"> Im a monster as well as a dwarf You should charge me double
<name="shae"> You think Im here for money?
<name="tyrion"> That was the arrangement we made I pay you and you lie to me

<name="luwin"> Thats exactly what they are, Bran, stories
<name="bran"> So she was lying? They dont exist?
<name="luwin"> Well, they may have done But theyre gone from the world, along with much else These are dreams, Bran, nothing more

<name="luwin"> What about all the dreams you had that didnt come true? Hmm? Right
<name="luwin"> This link is made of Valyrian steel Only one maester in 100 wears it on his chain It signifies that I have studied the higher mysteries And all who study these mysteries try their hand at spells I was no different I was young And what boy doesnt secretly wish for hidden powers to lift him out of his dull life into a special one? But in the end, for all my efforts, I got no more out of it than a thousand boys before me Come on

<name="brienne"> And you should kneel when you approach the King
<name="renly"> Theres no need for that Lady Stark is an honored guest
<name="loras"> Has your son marched against Tywin Lannister yet?
<name="catelyn"> I do not sit on my sons war councils And if I did, I would not share his strategies with you

<name="theon"> You lying bitch
<name="yara"> Its not my fault you didnt recognize me
<name="theon"> Recognize you? How could I? The last time I saw you you looked like a fat little boy
<name="yara"> You were a fat little boy, too, but I recognized you
<name="theon"> Why didnt you tell me?
<name="yara"> I wanted to see who you were first And I did
<name="balon"> The plans are made Its time you heard them
<name="yara"> Father
<name="theon"> Father
<name="balon"> The wolf pup has gone south with the entirety of the Northern army at his back While hes tangling with the lion in the Westerlands, the North is ripe for the taking The ironborn will reave and pillage, as it was in the old days, all along the northern coast Well spread our dominion across the green lands, securing the Neck and everything above Every stronghold will yield to us, one by one Winterfell may defy us for a year, but what of it? The rest shall be ours, forest, field, and hall Yara, my daughter, youll take 30 longships to attack Deepwood Motte
<name="yara"> Ive always wanted a castle
<name="theon"> And whats my role in all this?
<name="balon"> Youll take a ship to raid the fishing villages on the Stoney Shore
<name="theon"> A ship? You give her 30 and I get one?
<name="yara"> The Sea Bitch We thought shed be perfect for you
<name="theon"> Im to fight fishermen?
<name="yara"> Be careful of their nets
<name="theon"> Father, I fought with Robb Stark I know his men He wont give up the North so easily
<name="yara"> They wont even know were there until its too late
<name="theon"> What do you know of it, woman? Im a proven warrior
<name="balon"> Your brothers were warriors, both of them dead at the hands of those you seem so eager to protect
<name="theon"> Im not protecting anyone I just wonder if its not wiser to wait Why risk going against the North if they would be our allies? Rise up against them and they could destroy us But if we pledge fealty to them, theyll give us Casterly Rock
<name="balon"> What are our words? Our words?
<name="theon"> We do not sow
<name="balon"> We do not sow We are ironborn Were not subjects Were not slaves We do not plow the fields or toil in the mine We take what is ours Your time with the wolves has made you weak
<name="theon"> You act as if I volunteered to go You gave me away, if you remember The day you bent the knee to Robert Baratheon After he crushed you Did you take what was yours then?
<name="theon"> You gave me away! Your boy! Your last boy! You gave me away like I was some dog you didnt want anymore And now you curse me because Ive come home
<name="yara"> Youd have our father bow down to your other family?
<name="theon"> I have no other family
<name="yara"> Dont you? Make your choice, Theon, and do it quickly Our ships sail with or without you
<name="shae"> You wont let me leave this room You wont let me
<name="tyrion"> Keep your voice down
<name="shae"> Why? You think your father can hear me? Hes 300 miles away
<name="tyrion"> I dont intend for you to stay here I might be able to bring you into the castle kitchens Again, only temporary
<name="shae"> Every man who has tasted my cooking has told me what a good whore I am
<name="tyrion"> But you wouldnt be a cook Youd pose as a scullion
<name="shae"> Scullion? What is a scullion?
<name="tyrion"> Kitchen wench
<name="shae"> A kitchen wench?
<name="tyrion"> Yes
<name="but shae"> Cleaning pots? Is that how my lion wants to see me?
<name="tyrion"> Your lion wants to see you alive Weve come to a dangerous place My sister wants to hurt me Shell look for any weakness she can find She cant know about you
<name="shae"> Im the weakness?
<name="tyrion"> Its a compliment, my lady
<name="shae"> How is being a weakness a compliment?
<name="tyrion"> Language can be a bit tricky here
<name="shae"> Oh Im too stupid to understand The stupid foreign girl I am not a kitchen wench
<name="myrcella"> When will Joffrey and Sansa be married?
<name="cersei"> Soon, darling, when the war is over
<name="myrcella"> Mother says Ill have a new gown for the ceremony and another for the feast But yours will be ivory, since youre the bride
<name="cersei"> The princess just spoke to you
<name="sansa"> Pardon, Your Grace Im sure your dress will be beautiful, Myrcella Im counting the days until the fighting is done and I can pledge my love to the King in sight of the gods
<name="tommen"> Is Joffrey going to kill Sansas brother?
<name="cersei"> He might Would you like that?
<name="tommen"> No I dont think so
<name="cersei"> Even if he does, Sansa will do her duty Wont you, little dove?
<name="sansa"> Come in
<name="sansa"> Who are you?
<name="shae"> Im Shae, My Lady Your new handmaiden
<name="sansa"> I didnt know I needed a new handmaiden Youre not from here
<name="shae"> No
<name="sansa"> What are you doing?
<name="shae"> Waiting for you to tell me what to do
<name="sansa"> I shouldnt have to tell you to do things You should just do them
<name="shae"> What things?
<name="sansa"> Change my linens, wash my clothing, scrub the floor, empty my chamber pot, brush my hair
<name="sansa"> No
<name="shae"> You said to brush
<name="sansa"> Not now
<name="shae"> Your chamber pot is empty
<name="sansa"> Clean the table Have you ever been a handmaiden before?
<name="shae"> Yes
<name="sansa"> For whom?
<name="shae"> Lady Zuriff
<name="sansa"> Lady Zuriff
<name="shae"> Lady Zuriff
<name="sansa"> There is no Lady Zuriff in this city
<name="shae"> She wasnt in this city
<name="sansa"> I dont know how they did things in that city, but in this city, handmaidens wait on ladies, not the other way around And I dont have time to answer a thousand questions and teach you how to do your job
<name="shae"> Do you want me to leave?
<name="sansa"> Just brush my hair
<name="tyrion"> Oh! Thank the gods I havent had a proper shit in six days
<name="pycelle"> Ive encountered this problem before, my lord The stresses of power often have this insalubrious effect Two drops with water, daily
<name="tyrion"> Right Im so grateful to have a man of your vast knowledge and wisdom on my side
<name="pycelle"> Please Thank you, my lord
<name="tyrion"> I can trust you, Pycelle, can I not?
<name="pycelle"> Why, yes, of course, my lord
<name="tyrion"> These are perilous times And the crown must forge new alliances And these alliances must often be sealed in matrimony
<name="pycelle"> Matrimony, huh? Yes
<name="tyrion"> Im trusting the council with these plans, but the Queen mustnt know We cant have her meddling in affairs that could determine the future of the realm Theres too much at stake
<name="pycelle"> Oh, yes, yes Indeed, yes I shall be silent as the grave
<name="tyrion"> Im brokering an alliance with House Martell of Dorne Princess Myrcella will wed their youngest son when she comes of age, ensuring their loyalty and their army, should we need it
<name="pycelle"> Myrcella sent away to Dorne?
<name="tyrion"> But remember, the Queen mustnt know
<name="varys"> Ooh The Queen mustnt know I love conversations that begin this way
<name="tyrion"> I plan to marry Princess Myrcella off to Theon Greyjoy
<name="varys"> Theon Greyjoy? Forgive me, my lord, but how? He grew up a ward of Winterfell He fights for Robb Stark
<name="tyrion"> Precisely Theons father loathes the Starks and will convince the boy to come to our side Greyjoy can destroy the Northern army from within and we can have his fathers ships
<name="tyrion"> But remember, you must tell no one
<name="littlefinger"> Tell no one what?
<name="tyrion"> I plan to wed Princess Myrcella to Robin Arryn of the Vale Lysa is not fond of me But perhaps the promise of a royal match will convince her to let bygones be bygones
<name="littlefinger"> She imprisoned you She tried to execute you And you offer her son a princess?
<name="tyrion"> For men in our position, holding grudges can be an encumbrance, dont you think?
<name="littlefinger"> And I suppose you want me to broker this agreement?
<name="tyrion"> Who better?
<name="littlefinger"> Yes, I could sing this song to Lysa, if I cared to Whats in it for me?
<name="tyrion"> The gratitude of the people of Westeros for helping to end this war, the adoration of the King for bringing the Vale back into the fold and Harrenhal
<name="littlefinger"> Harrenhal is cursed
<name="tyrion"> Never took you for a superstitious man By all means, tear it down and rebuild Youll be able to afford it I plan to make you Lord of the Riverlands
<name="littlefinger"> With a single stroke, youd make me one of the greatest lords in the realm
<name="tyrion"> You served my family well in the matter of the succession
<name="littlefinger"> So did Janos Slynt, and he was given Harrenhal, too Until you snatched it away
<name="tyrion"> I need you to deliver Lysa Arryn I didnt need Janos Slynt Its settled, then?
<name="tyrion"> Good Oh
<name="and remember littlefinger"> The Queen mustnt know
<name="renly"> That must hurt
<name="renly"> What? What is it?
<name="loras"> A member of the Kingsguard? As if I wasnt humiliated enough already
<name="renly"> Brienne is a very capable warrior And shes devoted to me Youre jealous
<name="loras"> Jealous? Of Brienne the Beauty? Dont make me laugh
<name="renly"> Ill make it up to you
<name="loras"> No, Your Grace Not tonight Theres another Tyrell who requires your attention You didnt win my fathers support or his army on charm alone
<name="loras"> Your vassals are starting to snigger behind your back Brides arent usually virgins two weeks after their wedding night
<name="renly"> And Margaerys a virgin?
<name="loras"> Officially Shall I bring her to you?
<name="renly"> I should warn you, Ive had quite a bit of wine
<name="margaery"> As is your right You are a king
<name="renly"> You look very beautiful
<name="margaery"> Thank you, Your Grace
<name="renly"> Its a lovely gown
<name="margaery"> You think so? I cant decide how I like it better This way, or this way
<name="renly"> You certainly dont need it
<name="renly"> Although, some say the beauty most desired is the beauty concealed
<name="renly"> Must be the wine
<name="margaery"> Here, let me
<name="renly"> Im sorry
<name="margaery"> Do you want my brother to come in and help?
<name="renly"> What?
<name="margaery"> He could get you started I know he wouldnt mind Or I can turn over and you can pretend Im him
<name="renly"> I dont know what youre talking about
<name="margaery"> Theres no need for us to play games Save your lies for court Youre going to need a lot of them
<name="margaery"> Your enemies arent happy about us They want to tear us apart And the best way to stop them is to put your baby in my belly We can try again later You decide how you want to do it, with me, with me and Loras, however else you like Whatever you need to do You are a king
<name="cersel"> You monster Myrcella is my only daughter Do you really think Ill let you sell her like a common whore?
<name="tyrion"> Myrcellas a princess Some would say she was born for this
<name="cersei"> I will not let you ship her off to Dorne as I was shipped off to Robert Baratheon
<name="tyrion"> Dorne is the safest place for her
<name="cersei"> Are you mad? The Martells loathe us
<name="tyrion"> Thats why we need to seduce them Were going to need their support in the war your son started
<name="cersei"> Shell be a hostage
<name="tyrion"> A guest
<name="cersei"> You wont get away with this You think the piece of paper Father gave you keeps you safe Ned Stark had a piece of paper, too
<name="tyrion"> Its done, Cersei
<name="cersei"> No
<name="tyrion"> You cannot stop it
<name="cersei"> No
<name="tyrion"> Just how safe do you think Myrcella is if this city falls? Do you want to see her raped, butchered like the Targaryen children? Make no mistake Theyll mount her pretty little head on a spike right beside yours
<name="cersei"> Get out! Get out
<name="priest"> Theon of the House Greyjoy, you would this day consecrate your faith to the Drowned God?
<name="theon"> I would
<name="drowned priest"> Kneel
<name="drowned priest"> Let Theon, your servant, be born again from the sea as you were Bless him with salt Bless him with stone Bless him with steel
<name="theon"> What is dead may never die
<name="drowned priest"> What is dead may never die But rises again harder and stronger Stand
<name="littlefinger"> I dont appreciate being made a fool of, dwarf If Myrcella marries the Martell boy, she cant very well marry Robin Arryn, can she?
<name="tyrion"> No, afraid not Sorry about that
<name="littlefinger"> And Harrenhal, I suppose thats off the table as well
<name="tyrion"> Yes, I fear so Sorry about that, too
<name="littlefinger"> Leave me out of your next deception
<name="tyrion"> Thats a shame You were to be the centerpiece of my next deception My brother Jaime rots in a northern stockade I would see him released Thats where you come in
<name="littlefinger"> Robb Stark will never release the Kingslayer
<name="tyrion"> No, he wont But his mother might How would you like to see your beloved Cat again?
<name="tyrion"> Find him?
<name="bronn"> Oh, aye And he has company Filthy old stoat Almost hate to interrupt
<name="tyrion"> No, you dont
<name="bronn"> No, I dont
<name="pycelle"> What is the meaning of this? No, please, please
<name="tyrion"> You disappoint me, Grand Maester
<name="pycelle"> I am your loyal servant
<name="tyrion"> So loyal that you told the Queen about my plans to send Myrcella to Dorne
<name="pycelle"> No! Never! Its a falsehood I swear it It wasnt me Ah, Varys It was Varys the Spider
<name="tyrion"> See, I told Varys that I was giving the Princess to the Greyjoys I told Littlefinger that I planned to wed her to Robin Arryn I told no one that I was offering her to the Dornish No one but you
<name="pycelle"> The eunuch has spies everywhere
<name="tyrion"> Cut off his manhood and feed it to the goats
<name="pycelle"> No, no, no
<name="timett"> There are no goats, halfman
<name="tyrion"> Well, make do
<name="tyrion"> How long have you been spying for my sister?
<name="pycelle"> All I did, I did for House Lannister Always Your lord father, ask him Ive always been his servant since the days of the Mad King
<name="tyrion"> I dont like his beard
<name="pycelle"> What? What?
<name="pycelle"> No No
<name="tyrion"> How many Hands have you betrayed, Pycelle? Eddard Stark? Jon Arryn?
<name="pycelle"> Lord Arryn, he knew He knew the truth about the Queen And he planned to act, to tell King Robert
<name="tyrion"> So you poisoned him?
<name="pycelle"> No Never
<name="tyrion"> But you let him die, made sure he succumbed
<name="pycelle"> Lannister I always served Lannister
<name="tyrion"> Get him out of my sight Throw him in one of the black cells
<name="pycelle"> No No, no, no No, please Dont! You cant do this to me
<name="tyrion"> For your trouble
<name="varys"> Youll be pleased to know our mutual friend is doing quite well in Lady Sansas service
<name="tyrion"> Good One of my better ideas
<name="varys"> And it seems the Grand Maester has found his way into a black cell? Well played, My Lord Hand But should I be worried? Janos Slynt, Pycelle The Small Council grows smaller every day
<name="tyrion"> The Council has a reputation for serving past Hands poorly I dont mean to follow Ned Stark to the grave
<name="varys"> Power is a curious thing, my lord Are you fond of riddles?
<name="tyrion"> Why, am I about to hear one?
<name="varys"> Three great men sit in a room A king, a priest and a rich man Between them stands a common sellsword Each great man bids the sellsword kill the other two Who lives, who dies?
<name="tyrion"> Depends on the sellsword
<name="varys"> Does it? He has neither crown nor gold nor favor with the gods
<name="tyrion"> He has a sword, the power of life and death
<name="varys"> But if its swordsmen who rule, why do we pretend kings hold all the power? When Ned Stark lost his head, who was truly responsible? Joffrey? The executioner? Or something else?
<name="tyrion"> Ive decided I dont like riddles
<name="varys"> Power resides where men believe it resides Its a trick, a shadow on the wall And a very small man can cast a very large shadow
<name="yoren"> You should be sleeping Tomorrows a long march Thirty miles, if it dont piss on us
<name="arya"> I cant sleep
<name="arya"> I dont like the taste
<name="yoren"> You dont drink it for the flavor, to be honest What?
<name="arya"> How do you sleep?
<name="yoren"> Same as most men, I think
<name="arya"> But youve seen things, horrible things
<name="yoren"> Aye Ive seen some pretty things, too, but not nearly so many
<name="arya"> How do you sleep when you When you have those things in your head?
<name="yoren"> You didnt see that I made damn sure
<name="arya"> I close my eyes and I see them up there All of them standing there Joffrey, the Queen and and my sister
<name="yoren"> You know, weve got something in common, me and you You know that? I must have been a couple of years older than you I saw my brother stabbed through the heart right on our doorstep He werent much of a villain what skewered him Willem, the lads name was He ran off before anyone could spit And I just stood there, watching my brother die Heres the funny part I cant picture my brothers face anymore But Willem, oh, he was a nice-looking boy He had good white teeth, blue eyes, one of those dimpled chins all the girls like I would think about him when I was working, when I was drinking, when I was having a shit It got to the point where I would say his name every night before I went to bed Willem Willem Willem A prayer almost Well, one day, Willem came riding back into town I buried an ax so deep into Willems skull they had to bury him with it Willems horse got me to the Wall and Ive been wearing black ever since Well Thatll help you sleep, eh?

Season 3
EPISODE "AND NOW HIS WATCH IS ENDED" - 21/04/2013


<name="man"> How many of those fingers do you think we could shove up his ass?
<name="locke"> Depends if hes had any practice Is that the sort of thing you and your sister go in for, Kingslayer? She loosened you up for us?
<name="brienne"> Hes going to fall Hes going to fall off his horse Someone help him
<name="jaime"> Water Water Please, water Wa-water Water, please Please Please
<name="jaime"> If I die, you wont be getting-
<name="locke"> Oh, enough Here
<name="locke"> Cant say that Ive ever seen a man drink horse piss that fast
<name="brienne"> Stop
<name="man"> Far enough
<name="locke"> Do that again and Ill take your other hand
<name="man"> Come on, you
<name="varys"> Oh, Lord Tyrion Come in, come in
<name="tyrion"> I hope we might speak In confidence
<name="varys"> Oh, always in confidence
<name="tyrion"> About the events of the Blackwater Perhaps this is the wrong time?
<name="varys"> Oh, no Its a wonderful time
<name="tyrion"> I thought one of your little birds might have knowledge of my sisters intentions to-
<name="varys"> End your life?
<name="tyrion"> I didnt inherit Littlefingers spies along with his position, Im afraid Which is why Im coming to you I need proof
<name="varys"> Proof? Will there be a trial?
<name="tyrion"> I need to know
<name="varys"> I have no proof, only whispers Before all this nastiness, I was going to tell you the story of how I was cut Do you want to hear it still?
<name="tyrion"> I dont know Do I?
<name="varys"> As a boy, I travelled with a troupe of actors through the Free Cities One day in Myr, a certain man made my master an offer too tempting to refuse I feared the man meant to use me as Id heard some men used small boys But what he wanted was far worse He gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak, yet did nothing to dull my senses With a hooked blade he sliced me, root and stem, chanting all the while He burned my parts in a brazier The flames turned blue and I heard a voice answer his call I still dream of that night Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade I dream of the voice from the flames Was it a god? A demon? A conjurors trick? I dont know But the sorcerer called and a voice answered And ever since that day, I have hated magic and all those who practice it But you can see why I was eager to aid in your fight against Stannis and his Red Priestess A symbolic revenge of sorts
<name="tyrion"> Yes, ahem I feel the need for actual revenge against the actual person who tried to have me killed Which will require a degree of influence, which-
<name="varys"> You do not possess at the moment
<name="varys"> But influence is largely a matter of patience, I have found Once I had served the sorcerers purpose, he threw me out of his house to die I resolved to live to spite him I begged I sold what parts of my body remained to me I became an excellent thief and soon learned that the contents of a mans letters are more valuable than the contents of his purse Step by step, one distasteful task after another, I made my way from the slums of Myr to the small council chamber Influence grows like a weed I tended mine patiently until its tendrils reached from the Red Keep all the way across to the far side of the world where I managed to wrap them around something very special
<name="tyrion"> The sorcerer
<name="varys"> Hello, my old friend Its been a long time I have no doubt the revenge you want will be yours in time if you have the stomach for it
<name="grenn"> When people talk about the Nights Watch, they never mention the shoveling
<name="eddison"> Or the shit
<name="grenn"> They tell you about honor, pardoning crimes, and protecting the realm, but shoveling really is most of it
<name="eddison"> And getting attacked or killed or worse And that
<name="grenn"> But when youre not getting attacked or killed, usually youre shoveling
<name="eddison"> Oh, look More shit I was starting to wonder what to do with the rest of my day
<name="rast"> We need to get out of here
<name="grenn"> When the Lord Commander says we go, we go
<name="rast"> The Lord Commander told us to go to the Fist of the First Men Howd that turn out for us?
<name="eddison"> He had no way of knowing
<name="rast"> We do now We know whats out there
<name="grenn"> Crasters been out here surviving
<name="rast"> So hes your new protector now? Our good friend Craster?
<name="eddison"> Were like the sons he never had
<name="rast"> Mormont isnt gonna save you This lummox here isnt gonna save you When the walkers come calling, Craster will serve us up like so many pigs If we want to live well have to look out for ourselves
<name="gilly"> Shh, shh, shh
<name="gilly"> You woke him
<name="sam"> Im sorry Hes beautiful
<name="gilly"> Shh
<name="sam"> Hes beautiful Does he have a name?
<name="gilly"> No
<name="sam"> Are you going to give him one?
<name="gilly"> Why?
<name="gilly"> Here
<name="sam"> Gilly
<name="gilly"> You said to hold it for you until you came back Youre back
<name="sam"> I wanted you to have it
<name="gilly"> I dont want your stupid thimble I want to save my babys life Can you do that? Can you?
<name="gilly"> I dont have time for you I dont have time for anyone but him because he doesnt have much time
<name="jojen"> You have to go after him
<name="bran"> How?
<name="jojen"> You know how
<name="catelyn"> Brandon
<name="bran"> Mother
<name="catelyn"> How many times have I told you? No climbing
<name="bran"> Mother, I need to find it Its here Its calling me
<name="catelyn"> I want you to promise me No more climbing
<name="catelyn"> Promise me Promise me! Promise me
<name="bran"> Mother! Mother
<name="catelyn"> Promise me! Promise me, Bran! Promise me
<name="varys"> Is he very large?
<name="ros"> No larger than usual, apparently And yet they said that he was-
<name="varys"> Extraordinary
<name="ros"> The most extraordinary man theyve ever had And theyve had a lot of men
<name="varys"> Were talking about the same Podrick? The quiet boy in Lord Tyrions service? Seems a bit simple?
<name="varys"> What did he do to them?
<name="ros"> I dont know, my lord The girls are usually quite descriptive
<name="varys"> So what did they say?
<name="ros"> They said it was hard to describe
<name="varys"> Huh Prodigies appear in the oddest of places And what did Littlefinger say about this loss of income?
<name="ros"> He was too preoccupied to notice Hes leaving for the Eyrie soon Im helping him prepare for his journey
<name="varys"> Ah, yes, to pursue his enduring love of the Lady Arryn and the title that comes with her Sad, really Is that all it takes to make our friend lose interest in poor Sansa Stark?
<name="ros"> He hasnt spoken to her since the last time, as far as I know But I dont think hes lost interest
<name="varys"> What makes you say so?
<name="ros"> His shipboard inventory
<name="varys"> Ah You can read Rare for a woman in your profession
<name="ros"> Former profession
<name="varys"> Of course Im missing something obvious youre about to point out?
<name="ros"> Two featherbeds Hes bringing two featherbeds for the cabin
<name="varys"> Who is important enough to Littlefinger to merit a featherbed besides Littlefinger? Could he be bringing one of his girls?
<name="ros"> Hes not interested in them, my lord
<name="varys"> How do you know?
<name="ros"> Because Im one of his girls
<name="varys"> Prodigies in odd places indeed
<name="joffrey"> Rhaenyra Targaryen was murdered by her brother, or rather his dragon It ate her while her son watched Whats left of her is buried in the crypts right down there
<name="cersei"> The ceremony is traditionally held in the main sanctum, which seats 700 comfortably
<name="olenna"> There appears to be a good deal of room elsewhere on the premises for everyone else
<name="cersei"> There arent more than 700 people of any importance
<name="olenna"> No, the rest are there to look adoringly upon the 700 to remind them how superior they must be to have the best seats
<name="joffrey"> Over there in that urn, the ashes of Aerion Targaryen Aerion Brightflame they called him He thought drinking wildfire would turn him into a dragon
<name="joffrey"> He was wrong And, of course, theres the Mad King, killed by my uncle Would you like to see where the last Targaryens are buried?
<name="cersei"> Are you sure Lady Margaery doesnt find all this a bit macabre?
<name="margaery"> Oh, no, its quite all right, Your Grace Id love to see their tombs, really Its like taking a walk through history
<name="joffrey"> The tombs just up here
<name="margaery"> This is so exciting
<name="olenna"> You were married here, Your Grace?
<name="cersei"> Yes
<name="olenna"> Must seem like only yesterday
<name="cersei"> Seems like a lifetime ago
<name="olenna"> Your husband, was he buried here as well?
<name="cersei"> No, he wanted his remains returned to Storms End
<name="olenna"> Such a tragedy
<name="cersei"> A fairly predictable tragedy Hunting and drinking dont mix
<name="olenna"> I should say not My sons a hunter It helps him forget hes never been within a mile of a real battle
<name="cersei"> I seem to recall he laid siege to Storms End for the better part of a year
<name="olenna"> All he laid siege to was the banquet table in the command tent
<name="olenna"> I told him to stay out of Roberts rebellion He had no business fighting an actual warrior We mothers do what we can to keep our sons from the grave But they do seem to yearn for it We shower them with good sense, and it slides right off like rain off a wing
<name="cersei"> And yet the world belongs to them
<name="olenna"> A ridiculous arrangement, to my mind
<name="cersei"> The gods have seen fit to make it so
<name="joffrey"> My father didnt want them here He was going to have their bodies burned and thrown in the Blackwater, but the High Septon convinced him otherwise
<name="margaery"> Im glad he did Im sorry, Your Grace I know they did terrible things at the end, but their ancestors built this Sometimes severity is the price we pay for greatness
<name="joffrey"> I couldnt agree more
<name="margaery"> Shall we go and see them? If you give them your love, they will return it a thousandfold Ive spoken with them I know how they feel about you You led the defense of Kings Landing They adore you
<name="joffrey"> Open the doors
<name="cersei"> Joffrey Wait
<name="woman"> Lady Margaery
<name="woman"> Lady Margaery
<name="woman"> Bless you, Lady Margaery
<name="woman"> Lady Margaery
<name="woman"> Lady Margaery
<name="woman"> Margaery
<name="woman"> Long live Lady Margaery
<name="man"> King Joffrey
<name="woman"> King Joffrey
<name="woman"> King Joffrey
<name="man"> King Joffrey
<name="man"> Gods bless King Joffrey
<name="theon"> How far is it to Deepwood Motte?
<name="ramsay"> Not far, my lord Your sister is waiting for you there
<name="theon"> She sent you to save me?
<name="ramsay"> Yes I served them, the men who were torturing you I did what they told me and waited for the right moment
<name="theon"> Why would you risk your life for me?
<name="ramsay"> I grew up on Saltcliffe, my lord I was only a boy when they took you away My father brought me and my brothers up to the bluffs so we could watch the ship that carried you off I remember the look on my fathers face when he told us, Thats Balon Greyjoys last living son And those are the words I heard over and over again when I saw what they were doing to you
<name="theon"> Those men, they said my father knew what they were doing to me Did he?
<name="ramsay"> I I dont know, my lord They they never told me much
<name="theon"> My sisters men are loyal to her We dont need to hide from them
<name="ramsay"> Not all those are your sisters men Some of them are loyal to your father
<name="ramsay"> What is it?
<name="theon"> I was just thinking how jealous I was when my father told Yara to take this place
<name="ramsay"> What did he tell you to do?
<name="theon"> Raid fishing villages He didnt trust me Thought I was a Stark Ha I could never be a Stark Robb Stark always reminded me of that
<name="ramsay"> He lorded it over you?
<name="theon"> Didnt have to All he had to do was be Be who he was born to be His life fit him better than his clothes How could someone like that ever be a brother to me? Hes the King in the North
<name="theon"> And me my father gave me a choice and I made it I could never be a Stark But ironborn, thats what I was born to be I paid the iron price for Winterfell I murdered those boys
<name="ramsay"> The Stark boys?
<name="theon"> Never found them Just some poor orphans living with a farmer I let Dagmer slit their throats and I let him burn the bodies so I could keep Winterfell and make my father proud
<name="ramsay"> Maybe its not too late
<name="theon"> It is My real father lost his head at Kings Landing I made a choice and I chose wrong And now Ive burned everything down
<name="ramsay"> Not everything, my lord Shes up here
<name="theon"> Yara
<name="ramsay"> Shh Wait
<name="ramsay"> I brought him back He killed the others
<name="theon"> What? No, I didnt
<name="theon"> You cant! No, please stop! No
<name="ramsay"> Put him back where he belongs
<name="brienne"> Eat What are you doing?
<name="jaime"> Im dying
<name="brienne"> You cant die You need to live to take revenge
<name="jaime"> I dont care about revenge
<name="brienne"> You coward A little misfortune and youre giving up
<name="jaime"> Misfor misfortune?
<name="brienne"> You lost your hand
<name="jaime"> My sword hand I was that hand
<name="brienne"> You have a taste one taste of the real world where people have important things taken from them and you whine and cry and quit You sound like a bloody woman
<name="brienne"> I know what you did for me You told them Tarth was full of sapphires Its called the Sapphire Isle because of the blue of its water You knew that Why did you help me?
<name="tywin"> You wanted to speak to me?
<name="cersei"> Yes, about Jaime
<name="tywin"> What about him?
<name="cersei"> I wanted to make sure were doing everything we can to get him back
<name="tywin"> When Catelyn Stark took Tyrion prisoner what did I do in response?
<name="cersei"> You started a war
<name="tywin"> And if I would start a war for that lecherous little stump, what do you think I am doing for my oldest son and heir?
<name="cersei"> Whatever you can
<name="tywin"> Whatever I can
<name="tywin"> Youre still here
<name="cersei"> Yes
<name="tywin"> Why?
<name="cersei"> Did it ever occur to you that I might be the one who deserves your confidence and your trust, not your sons? Not Jaime or Tyrion, but me Years and years of lectures on family and legacy the same lecture, really, just with tiny, tedious variations did it ever occur to you that your daughter might be the only one listening to them? Living by them? That she might have the most to contribute to your legacy that you love so much more than your actual children?
<name="tywin"> All right Contribute
<name="cersei"> The Tyrells are a problem
<name="tywin"> The Tyrells helped us defeat Stannis Baratheon The Tyrells saved your life, your childrens lives
<name="cersei"> Margaery has her claws in Joffrey She knows how to manipulate him
<name="tywin"> Good I wish you knew how to manipulate him I dont distrust you because youre a woman I distrust you because youre not as smart as you think you are Youve allowed that boy to ride roughshod over you and everyone else in this city
<name="cersei"> Perhaps you should try stopping him from doing what he likes
<name="tywin"> I will
<name="maid"> Do you like it, Nana?
<name="olenna"> Another golden rose How original I eat from plates stamped with roses I sleep in sheets embroidered with roses I have a golden rose painted on my chamber pot, as if that makes it smell any better Roses are boring, dear Growing strong Ha! The dullest words of any house Winter is coming! Now thats memorable We do not sow Strong Strong Those are houses you watch out for Direwolves and krakens, fierce beasts But a golden rose growing strong ha, that strikes fear in the heart
<name="olenna"> Look, little loves A spider in the garden Run along now Grow strong
<name="varys"> My lady I wanted to personally welcome you to Kings Landing The city has been made brighter by your presence
<name="olenna"> The city is made brighter by my presence? Is that your usual line, Lord Varys? Are you here to seduce me?
<name="varys"> A little obvious, perhaps
<name="olenna"> Oh, no, please Seduce away Its been so long Though I rather think its all for naught What happens when the nonexistent bumps against the decrepit? A question for the philosophers But youve come mincing all this way for something So?
<name="varys"> Might I sit?
<name="olenna"> No Come, Ive heard youre such a clever man Im curious why youve sought me out
<name="varys"> Youve taken an interest in Sansa Stark
<name="olenna"> Have I? Because I spoke to her once in this garden and one of your little spies came running to tell you? Why shouldnt I take an interest? Shes an interesting girl
<name="varys"> Is she?
<name="olenna"> No, not particularly But shes had an interesting childhood
<name="varys"> She has, sadly Well, forgive me for wasting your time, then I thought we shared certain hopes for her well-being
<name="olenna"> Come, come You surrender rather easily Walk with me I know the walls have ears, but apparently the shrubbery does, too
<name="varys"> I choose my allies carefully and my enemies more carefully still
<name="olenna"> Which is Sansa Stark?
<name="varys"> Neither A babe in the woods I admired her father
<name="olenna"> Yes Ned Stark had many admirers, and how many stepped forward when the executioner came for his head?
<name="varys"> I could not help Lord Stark Perhaps I can help his daughter
<name="olenna"> How?
<name="varys"> Youre not the only one who has taken an interest in her
<name="olenna"> Thats hardly surprising Shes a beautiful girl with a famous name
<name="varys"> Indeed Shed make a lovely match for the right suitor
<name="olenna"> It almost feels as if youre about to arrive at the point
<name="varys"> Littlefinger is not long for the capital A confidant of mine has told me that when he goes, Sansa Stark goes with him
<name="olenna"> And why have you come to me with this matter?
<name="varys"> Littlefinger was born with no lands, no wealth, no armies He has acquired the first two How long before he has the army?
<name="varys"> Perhaps youll laugh, but I know him better than most and this is the truth Littlefinger is one of the most dangerous men in Westeros If Robb Stark falls, Sansa Stark is the key to the North
<name="olenna"> And if Littlefinger marries her, hell have the key in his pocket
<name="varys"> Which seems such a shame Why should a man with such a low reputation steal away such a lovely bride?
<name="olenna"> You must despise him Youre working so hard to undermine him
<name="varys"> Actually, I rather enjoy him But he would see this country burn if he could be king of the ashes
<name="olenna"> You are a clever man, Lord Varys
<name="varys"> You are too kind I believe I have a possible solution
<name="olenna"> One doesnt need to be clever for that Its all rather obvious, isnt it?
<name="margaery"> Ahem I didnt mean to disturb you
<name="sansa"> You havent
<name="margaery"> Wed like some privacy, please If you wouldnt mind waiting back inside the keep Or if youd be kind enough to give me your names, Ill ask the king to speak with you himself
<name="margaery"> What did you pray for?
<name="sansa"> I cant tell you
<name="margaery"> Why not? Ill tell you what I prayed for in the sept this morning Lets see, for my familys health and happiness, for an end to the war, for a short winter Boring and traditional, Im afraid And you?
<name="sansa"> Im sorry, I just cant
<name="margaery"> My cousin Alanna was the most beautiful girl Id ever seen When I was 12, I was all elbows and knees and Alanna looked like a goddess sent to torture me Pig-face, she called me
<name="sansa"> Pig-face? Thats ridiculous
<name="margaery"> I think it had something to do with my nose Whenever she passed me in the halls, shed oink

<name="thoros"> Not easy finding molasses in wartime
<name="gendry"> Id have some
<name="thoros"> Lets go home
<name="gendry"> What is this place?
<name="thoros"> Somewhere neither wolves nor lions come prowling
<name="sandor"> You look like a bunch of swineherds
<name="anguy"> Some of us were swineherds And some of us tanners and masons That was before
<name="sandor"> Youre still swineherds and tanners and masons You think carrying a crooked spear makes you a soldier?
<name="beric"> No Fighting in a war makes you a soldier
<name="sandor"> Beric Dondarrion? Youve seen better days
<name="beric"> And I wont see them again
<name="sandor"> Stark deserters Baratheon deserters You lot arent fighting in a war Youre running from it
<name="beric"> Last I heard, you were King Joffreys guard dog But here you are 1000 miles from home Which of us is running?
<name="sandor"> Untie these ropes and well find out What are you doing leading a mob of peasants?
<name="beric"> Ned Stark ordered me to execute your brother in King Roberts name
<name="sandor"> Ned Stark is dead King Robert is dead My brothers alive
<name="sandor"> Youre fighting for ghosts
<name="beric"> Thats what we are ghosts waiting for you in the dark You cant see us, but we see you No matter whose cloak you wear Lannister, Stark, Baratheon you prey on the weak, the Brotherhood without Banners will hunt you down
<name="sandor"> You found god? Is that it?
<name="beric"> Aye Ive been reborn in the light of the one true god As have we all As would any man whos seen the things weve seen
<name="sandor"> If you mean to murder me, then bloody well get on with it
<name="thoros"> Youll die soon enough, dog But it wont be murder, only justice
<name="anguy"> And a kinder fate than you deserve Lions you call yourselves At the Mummers Ford, girls of seven years were raped and babes still on the breast were cut in two while their mothers watched
<name="sandor"> I wasnt at the Mummers Ford Dump your dead children at some other door
<name="thoros"> House Clegane was built upon dead children I saw them lay Prince Aegon and Princess Rhaenys before the Iron Throne
<name="sandor"> Do you take me for my brother? Is being born Clegane a crime?
<name="anguy"> Murder is a crime
<name="sandor"> I never touched the Targaryen babes I never saw them, never smelled them, never heard them bawling You want to cut my throat, get on with it! But dont call me murderer and pretend that youre not
<name="arya"> You murdered Mycah The butchers boy My friend He was 12 years old He was unarmed And you rode him down You slung him over your horse like he was some deer
<name="sandor"> Aye, he was a bleeder
<name="beric"> You dont deny killing this boy?
<name="sandor"> I was Joffreys sworn shield The boy attacked the prince
<name="arya"> Thats a lie! I hit Joffrey Mycah just ran away
<name="sandor"> Then I should have killed you Not my place to question princes
<name="beric"> You stand accused of murder But no one here knows the truth of the charge, so it is not for us to judge you Only the Lord of Light may do that now I sentence you to trial by combat
<name="sandor"> So, who will it be? Should we find out if your fire god really loves you, priest? Or you, archer? What are you worth with a sword in your hand? Or is the little girl the bravest one here?
<name="beric"> Aye She might be But its me youll fight
<name="missandei"> The master says they are untested He says you would be wise to blood them early There are many small cities between here and there, cities ripe for sacking Should you take captives, the masters will buy the healthy ones and for a good price
<name="missandei"> And who knows? In 10 years, some of the boys you send them may be Unsullied in their turn Thus all shall prosper
<name="daenerys"> Is it done, then? They belong to me?
<name="kraznys"> It is done
<name="missandei"> It is done
<name="kraznys"> She holds the whip
<name="missandei"> You hold the whip
<name="kraznys"> The bitch has her army
<name="daenerys"> Unsullied
<name="daenerys"> Forward march
<name="daenerys"> Halt
<name="kraznys"> Tell the bitch her beast wont come
<name="daenerys"> A dragon is not a slave
<name="kraznys"> You speak Valyrian?
<name="daenerys"> I am Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, of the blood of Old Valyria Valyrian is my mother tongue
<name="daenerys"> Unsullied! Slay the masters, slay the soldiers, slay every man who holds a whip, but harm no child Strike the chains off every slave you see
<name="kraznys"> I am your master
<name="kraznys"> Kill her! Kill her! Kill her
<name="daenerys"> Dracarys
<name="daenerys"> Unsullied! You have been slaves all your life. Today you are free. Any man who wishes to leave may leave, and no one will harm him. I give you my word. Will you fight for me? As free men?

<name="brienne"> Gods, no
<name="jaime"> Ah, Renly Really? He wasnt fit to rule over anything more important than a 12-course meal
<name="brienne"> Shut your mouth
<name="jaime"> Why? I lived with him at court since he was a boy, dont forget Could hardly escape the little tulip Skipping down the corridors in his embroidered silks I knew him far better than you
<name="brienne"> I knew him as well as anyone As a member of his Kingsguard, he trusted me with everything He would have been a wonderful king
<name="jaime"> Sounds like you quite fancied him
<name="brienne"> I did not fancy him
<name="jaime"> Oh, gods, you did
<name="jaime"> Did you ever tell him? No, of course not You werent Renlys type, Im afraid
<name="jaime"> He preferred curly-haired little girls like Loras Tyrell Youre far too much man for him
<name="brienne"> Im not interested in foul rumors
<name="jaime"> Unless theyre about me Its all true about Renly His proclivities were the worst kept secret at court Its a shame the throne isnt made out of cocks Theyd have never got him off it
<name="brienne"> Shut your mouth
<name="jaime"> I dont blame him And I dont blame you, either We dont get to choose who we love

<name="tailor"> Yes, Your Grace
<name="joffrey"> Bloody flowers On the king

<name="cersei"> Tell me what you think of her
<name="joffrey"> Who?
<name="cersei"> Margaery
<name="joffrey"> Shes an ideal match With the Tyrells beside us, well crush the Northerners Hang their lords, burn their strongholds, sow their fields with salt, and no one will think of rebelling for another century
<name="cersei"> It is a good match, but what do you think of her? Shes beautiful and intelligent
<name="joffrey"> Yes, she is
<name="cersei"> Her concern with the well-being of the common people is interesting
<name="joffrey"> Not to me
<name="cersei"> I only meant that to go out of your way to endanger yourself
<name="joffrey"> This is becoming one of the most boring conversations Ive ever had
<name="cersei"> Margaery Tyrell dotes on filthy urchins for a reason She dresses like a harlot for a reason She married a traitor and known degenerate like Renly Baratheon for a reason
<name="joffrey"> She married Renly Baratheon because she was told to Thats what intelligent women do-what theyre told
<name="cersei"> You need to ask yourself
<name="joffrey"> I dont need to do anything
<name="joffrey"> Better Much better
<name="shae"> I still dont believe it
<name="sansa"> He didnt He didnt want anything He just takes an interest because he loved my mother
<name="shae"> Men only want one thing from a pretty girl
<name="sansa"> Littlefingers not in love with me
<name="shae"> Love is not the thing he wants
<name="sansa"> Hes too old
<name="shae"> They never see it that way He didnt ask you to do something for him? Spy on someone or?
<name="sansa"> No
<name="shae"> If he does ask you for anything or try anything or touch you, I want you to tell me
<name="sansa"> Why? What will you do? I will make him stop
<name="guard"> Ser Loras Tyrell, my lady
<name="sansa"> Send him in
<name="loras"> Lady Sansa
<name="sansa"> Ser Loras
<name="loras"> My sister Margaery invites you to take the air with her and our grandmother the Lady Olenna in the gardens May I escort you to them?
<name="loras"> I believe you grow more beautiful every day, Lady Sansa
<name="sansa"> You are too kind, Ser Loras You probably dont remember the first time we met At the Hands tourney, you gave me your favor A rose, a red rose
<name="loras"> Of course I did
<name="margaery"> Its more your color You take it
<name="maid"> Thank you
<name="margaery"> Youre such a dear
<name="loras"> Ill take my leave Lady Sansa
<name="sansa"> Thank you, Ser Loras
<name="margaery"> Come Lady Sansa, it is my honor to present my grandmother the Lady Olenna of House Tyrell
<name="olenna"> Kiss me, child
<name="olenna"> Its so good of you to visit me and my foolish flock of hens Were very sorry for your losses
<name="sansa"> And I was sorry when I heard of Lord Renlys death, Lady Margaery He was very gallant
<name="olenna"> Gallant, yes And charming and very clean He knew how to dress and smile and somehow this gave him the notion he was fit to be king
<name="margaery"> Renly was brave and gentle, Grandmother Father liked him and so did Loras
<name="olenna"> Loras is young and very good at knocking men off horses with a stick That does not make him wise As to your fathead father
<name="margaery"> Grandmother! What will Sansa think of us?
<name="olenna"> She might think we have some wits about us One of us, at any rate It was treason I warned them Robert has two sons and Renly has an older brother How could he possibly have any claim to that ugly iron chair? We should have stayed well out of all this if you ask me But once the cows been milked, theres no squirting the cream back up her udders So here we are to see things through What do you say to that, Sansa? Shall we have some lemon cakes?
<name="sansa"> Lemon cakes my favorite
<name="olenna"> So weve been told Are you going to bring the food or do you mean to starve us to death? Here, Sansa, come sit with me Im much less boring than these others
<name="olenna"> Do you know my son? The Lord of Highgarden?
<name="sansa"> I havent had the pleasure
<name="olenna"> No great pleasure, believe me A ponderous oaf His father was an oaf as well My husband, the late Lord Luthor He managed to ride off a cliff whilst hawking They say he was looking up at the sky and paying no mind to where his horse was taking him And now my son is doing the same, only this time hes riding a lion instead of a horse Now I want you to tell me the truth about this royal boy, this Joffrey
<name="sansa"> I , I-
<name="olenna"> You, you Who else would know better? Weve heard some troubling tales Is there any truth to them? Has this boy mistreated you?
<name="olenna"> Has he ripped out your tongue?
<name="sansa"> Joff-King Joffrey, he-His Grace is very fair and handsome and as brave as a lion
<name="olenna"> Yes, all Lannisters are lions And when a Tyrell farts, it smells like a rose But how kind is he? How clever? Has he a good heart, a gentle hand?
<name="margaery"> Im to be his wife I only want to know what that means
<name="olenna"> Bring me some cheese
<name="servant"> The cheese will be served after the cakes, my lady
<name="olenna"> The cheese will be served when I want it served And I want it served now
<name="olenna"> Are you frightened, child? No need for that Were only women here Tell us the truth No harm will come to you
<name="sansa"> My father always told the truth
<name="olenna"> Yes, he had that reputation And they named him traitor and took his head
<name="sansa"> Joffrey Joffrey did that He promised he would be merciful and he cut my fathers head off And he said that was mercy Then he took me up on the walls and made me look at it
<name="olenna"> Go on
<name="sansa"> I-I cant I never meant-my father was a traitor My brother as well I have traitors blood Please dont make me say anymore
<name="margaery"> Shes terrified, Grandmother Just look at her
<name="olenna"> Speak freely, child We would never betray your confidence, I swear it
<name="sansa"> Hes a monster
<name="olenna"> Ah Thats a pity
<name="sansa"> Please, dont stop the wedding
<name="olenna"> Have no fear The Lord Oaf of Highgarden is determined that Margaery shall be queen Even so, we thank you for the truth Ah, here comes my cheese
<name="rickard kar"> Were at war This march is a distraction
<name="robb"> My grandfathers funeral is not a distraction
<name="rickard kar"> Are we riding to battle at Riverrun?
<name="robb"> No
<name="rickard kar"> Then its a distraction
<name="robb"> My Uncle Edmure has his forces garrisoned there We need his men
<name="rickard kar"> Unless hes been breeding them, he dont have enough to make a difference
<name="robb"> Have you lost faith in our cause?
<name="rickard kar"> If its revenge, I still got faith in it
<name="robb"> If you no longer believe
<name="rickard kar"> I can believe till it snows in Dorne Dont change the fact that weve got half the men
<name="robb"> You dont think we can win?
<name="rickard kar"> May I speak my mind, Your Grace?
<name="robb"> Have you not been speaking your mind, Lord Karstark?
<name="rickard kar"> I think you lost this war the day you married her
<name="talisa"> Whoa, whoa
<name="man"> Your Grace
<name="catelyn"> Youre afraid of her And she knows it
<name="talisa"> Im not afraid of her May I help you, Lady Stark?
<name="catelyn"> No
<name="talisa"> Im sorry, I shouldnt have
<name="catelyn"> You cant help because a mother makes one for her children to protect them Only a mother can make them
<name="talisa"> Youve made them before?
<name="catelyn"> Twice
<name="talisa"> Did they work?
<name="catelyn"> After a fashion I prayed for my son Bran to survive his fall
<name="catelyn"> Many years before that, one of the boys came down with the pox Maester Luwin said if he made it through the night, hed live But it would be a very long night So I sat with him all through the darkness Listened to his ragged little breaths, his coughing, his whimpering
<name="talisa"> Which boy?
<name="catelyn"> Jon Snow When my husband brought that baby home from the war, I couldnt bear to look at him I didnt want to see those brown strangers eyes staring up at me So I prayed to the gods, take him away Make him die He got the pox And I knew I was the worst woman who ever lived A murderer Id condemned this poor, innocent child to a horrible death all because I was jealous of his mother A woman he didnt even know So I prayed to all seven gods, let the boy live Let him live and Ill love him Ill be a mother to him Ill beg my husband to give him a true name, to call him Stark and be done with it, to make him one of us
<name="talisa"> And he lived
<name="catelyn"> And he lived And I couldnt keep my promise And everything thats happened since then all this horror thats come to my family its all because I couldnt love a motherless child
<name="mance"> Was it hard for you to kill the Halfhand?
<name="jon"> Yes
<name="mance"> You liked him? I like you, but if youre playing us false, it wont be hard for me to kill you Ive got wildling blood in my veins These are my people
<name="jon"> I understand
<name="mance"> Well, how could you understand?
<name="jon"> You want to protect your people
<name="mance"> Do you know what it takes to unite 90 clans, half of whom want to massacre the other half for one insult or another? They speak seven different languages in my army The Thenns hate the Hornfoots The Hornfoots hate the ice-river clans Everyone hates the cave people So you know how I got moon worshippers and cannibals and giants to march together in the same army?
<name="jon"> No
<name="mance"> I told them we were all going to die if we dont get south Because thats the truth
<name="tormund"> Shouldnt be long now
<name="jon"> Whats wrong with him?
<name="mance"> Hes a warg He can enter the mind of animals, see through their eyes Hes scouting for us

<name="gendry"> But you could have ended the war
<name="arya"> Where are we going?
<name="gendry"> North
<name="arya"> If we were going north, we should have come to the Red Fork River by now

<name="anguy"> Heres the thing
<name="fat anguy"> When Im done talking, that arrows falling down on your fat head So I advise you move, because Im done talking
<name="anguy"> Half the countrys starving and look at this one
<name="thoros"> Maybe hes the reason half the countrys starving
<name="shae"> My lion
<name="tyrion"> Weve spoken of this You cannot come here
<name="shae"> But you said I should come to you with any problems
<name="tyrion"> Did anyone see you? No
<name="shae"> No
<name="tyrion"> You sure? My father does not make idle threats Having you killed would be the high point of his week You have to be absolutely certain
<name="tyrion"> All right What is this problem?
<name="shae"> Im worried about Sansa When she spoke with Lord Baelish, his friend warned me about him
<name="tyrion"> Baelish doesnt have friends
<name="shae"> I dont know her name
<name="tyrion"> Oh, Ros? The redhead?
<name="shae"> How do you know her?
<name="tyrion"> I try to know as many people as I can You never know which one youll need
<name="shae"> Shes a whore
<name="tyrion"> Yes, well, we shouldnt be judgmental about these things
<name="shae"> You fucked her
<name="tyrion"> Oh, please All right, yes, I fucked her once Twice
<name="tyrion"> But since I met you, my lady, Ive been with no one else
<name="shae"> And was she good? Did you like her?
<name="tyrion"> Not as much as I like you, obviously, or shed be the one torturing me right now What did she say about Littlefinger?
<name="shae"> That Sansa shouldnt trust him
<name="tyrion"> Is there an idiot in any village who trusts Littlefinger?
<name="shae"> We have to protect her
<name="tyrion"> We cant Now that the Lannisters have discarded her, Sansa will have many suitors A great beauty with a very old name
<name="shae"> A great beauty? Oh, a great beauty?
<name="tyrion"> Yes, she is, objectively, very Her face is quite pleasing-to other men and to women, people in general But not to me, of course I only have eyes for you
<name="shae"> You pervert You want her? This child?
<name="tyrion"> I dont even want to talk about her
<name="shae"> But you are
<name="tyrion"> Only because youre making me
<name="shae"> I didnt force you to open your mouth and make words come out
<name="tyrion"> This is cruel and unfair Cruelly unfair
<name="shae"> Oh, the cruelty Shae is so cruel to me
<name="tyrion"> Hmm, yes
<name="shae"> Now do you think Im cruel?
<name="tyrion"> Only if you stop But you mustnt come here again
<name="tyrion"> Do you hear me? Youve come to a dangerous place full of dangerous people Dangerous people
<name="guard"> Lady Tyrell, my king
<name="joffrey"> Send her in
<name="margaery"> You wanted to see me, Your Grace?
<name="joffrey"> Im leaving on a hunting trip I just wanted to make sure you had everything you need before I left
<name="margaery"> Thats very thoughtful, Your Grace I have everything I could want
<name="joffrey"> Good Good How are you finding life in the capital? It must be quite a change after Renlys camp
<name="margaery"> A welcome one A military encampment is no place for a lady
<name="joffrey"> And the bedside of a traitor? Is that a place for a lady?
<name="margaery"> Your Grace, I tried to do my duty as a wife, that is all
<name="joffrey"> What was your duty to this traitor as you saw it?
<name="margaery"> The duty of any wife to any husband-to provide him with children
<name="joffrey"> You failed to do this
<name="margaery"> Why? I-I would not speak ill of the dead, Your Grace
<name="joffrey"> You think one ought to speak kindly of a traitor merely because hes had a sword put through his heart?
<name="margaery"> No I do beg your pardon The subtleties of politics are often lost on me Renly I dont believe he was interested in the company of women
<name="joffrey"> What makes you say this?
<name="margaery"> Whenever I wanted to make a child with him, he-he had so many excuses, so many late-night war councils He never wanted to try Except one evening, after hed had far too much wine to drink, he suggested something-something that sounded very painful and couldnt possibly result in children Maybe the fault was with me
<name="joffrey"> No, he was a known degenerate
<name="margaery"> Its such a relief to hear you say so, Your Grace
<name="joffrey"> Mmm Ive considered making his perversion punishable by death
<name="margaery"> As is your right You must do whatever you need to do
<name="margaery"> You are the king
<name="joffrey"> Yes I am
<name="joffrey"> Do you like it? I just had it made Probably one of the finest weapons in the Seven Kingdoms
<name="margaery"> Its beautiful Will you show me how it works?
<name="joffrey"> Its a new design Much easier to load Theres no crank You use this lever to draw the string
<name="joffrey"> The bolt goes here
<name="joffrey"> And then you just aim and
<name="margaery"> Would you take me hunting sometime? Forgive me, Your Grace I know a hunt is no place for a woman
<name="joffrey"> Its not unheard of
<name="margaery"> My father would never let me before
<name="joffrey"> You no longer belong to him Do you want to hold it?
<name="margaery"> May I? Please
<name="margaery"> I imagine it must be so exciting to squeeze your finger here and watch something die over there
<name="joffrey"> Could you do it? Could you kill something?
<name="margaery"> I dont know, Your Grace Do you think I could?
<name="joffrey"> Yes
<name="margaery"> Would you like to watch me?
<name="joffrey"> Yes
<name="theon"> Stop! Stop
<name="torturer"> Tell us the truth
<name="theon"> About what?
<name="theon"> I dont know what you want
<name="torturer"> I want the truth
<name="theon"> What truth?
<name="torturer"> Whyd you take Winterfell?
<name="theon"> I took it to-I took it
<name="torturer"> Who gave the orders?
<name="theon"> No one I took it on my own
<name="torturer"> Why?
<name="theon"> To take the North while it was vulnerable
<name="torturer"> What were you going to do once you took it?
<name="theon"> Hold it Rule it
<name="torturer"> Good Thats very good
<name="theon"> Why did you do that?
<name="torturer"> I told you Why did you take Winterfell?
<name="theon"> I took it to bring glory to my house and my father
<name="theon"> Wait Wait, wait, wait I took it because I hated the Starks I hated them for holding me prisoner I wanted to hurt them
<name="theon"> What are you doing?
<name="theon"> Please
<name="theon"> Ill tell you anything Just take it off Please Please, just take it off
<name="ramsay"> Your sister sent me
<name="theon"> Yara?
<name="ramsay"> Ill come for you tonight when the castle sleeps
<name="theon"> No, dont go Please, please No, please dont leave me Please, please Please, please dont go! Please Please Dont leave me Please dont go
<name="osha"> Rickon, stay with us
<name="bran"> Its all right The wolves will protect him
<name="jojen"> You can get inside his head, see through his eyes
<name="bran"> Only when Im asleep
<name="jojen"> Thats how it begins until you learn to control it Youre a warg
<name="bran"> Its not just wolves Sometimes in my dreams theres a
<name="jojen"> A three-eyed raven?
<name="bran"> Youve seen it?
<name="jojen"> We saw him together You havent forgotten?
<name="bran"> Does it have anything to do with warging?
<name="jojen"> No, the raven is something different, something deeper The raven brings the sight
<name="bran"> Seeing things that havent happened yet?
<name="jojen"> Or things that happened long before you were born or things that are happening right now thousands of miles away
<name="osha"> Whats he telling him?
<name="meera"> Why dont you ask?
<name="osha"> Isnt he ashamed, your brother, needing you to protect him?
<name="meera"> Wheres the shame in that?
<name="osha"> Any boy his age who needs his sister to protect him is gonna find himself needing lots of protecting
<name="meera"> Some people will always need help That doesnt mean theyre not worth helping
<name="bran"> When my father died, I dreamt it
<name="jojen"> You didnt dream it You saw it So did I
<name="bran"> You have the sight, too?
<name="jojen"> When I told my father about your father for the first time in my life, I saw him cry
<name="bran"> Your father is Howland Reed? Yeah
<name="jojen"> Yeah
<name="bran"> He saved my fathers life during the rebellion
<name="jojen"> Your father told you about the rebellion? Mine never did But I saw that, too
<name="bran"> What else have you seen?
<name="jojen"> Only one thing that matters-you
<name="man"> I never liked the skinny ones Like drinking from a puddle Not that Im averse to drinking from a puddle every now and again, you understand
<name="arya"> I dont drink ale
<name="thoros"> Theres no story so good a drink wont make it better
<name="man"> Yeah
<name="thoros"> You see? Theyve all suffered through my bouts of sobriety Its very tedious for all concerned Now, how did three children
<name="arya"> Were not children
<name="thoros"> How did three young persons such as yourselves, untrained in the art of war, escape from Harrenhal?
<name="arya"> Gendrys a smith He was apprenticed in the armory
<name="thoros"> A smith, eh? Whered you train?
<name="gendry"> Kings Landing Tobho Motts shop
<name="thoros"> That criminal He charges twice as much as every other armorer in the city
<name="gendry"> Thats because hes twice as good
<name="thoros"> Aha! A smith and a salesman
<name="arya"> Gendry stole us weapons
<name="thoros"> Ah, fought your way out of Harrenhal, I see
<name="arya"> He knows how to use a sword and so do I
<name="arya"> My brothers taught me
<name="men"> Ooh
<name="thoros"> To your brothers
<name="thoros"> You can finish your meals before you go It may be awhile before you see another
<name="arya"> Youll free us?
<name="thoros"> I gave you my word But before you go, allow me to raise a cup to your
<name="anguy"> Hey, hey
<name="thoros"> Now that is an uncommonly large person How does one manage to subdue such an uncommonly large person?
<name="anguy"> One waits for him to drink until he passes out
<name="thoros"> Poor man You have my sympathy
<name="thoros"> Aha, not a man at all A Hound
<name="thoros"> So good to see you again, Clegane
<name="sandor"> Thoros? The fuck you doing here?
<name="thoros"> Drinking and talking too much Same as ever
<name="thoros"> A pretty prize, lads
<name="men"> Yeah
<name="sandor"> Girl
<name="sandor"> What in seven hells are you doing with the Stark bitch?
<name="jaime"> Its a tough decision-take the bridge and risk being seen or cross the great water
<name="brienne"> Silence, Kingslayer
<name="jaime"> Anyone can see us on the bridge, but cross by water and the current could take us or I could escape down the river
<name="brienne"> Good luck
<name="jaime"> Its wonderful to watch you wrestle with these dilemmas Which will she choose?
<name="jaime"> Gambler at heart Wouldnt have guessed
<name="brienne"> Be quick about it
<name="jaime"> I need to rest
<name="brienne"> Get up
<name="jaime"> I have these, you know, on your feet when you walk too far What do you call them?
<name="brienne"> Get up now
<name="jaime"> Corns I never used to get corns Of course I used to ride everywhere, not march around like a common foot soldier wearing the same shit boots for over a year
<name="jaime"> This heel is ruined Theres no way
<name="jaime"> I never understood why some knights felt the need to carry two swords
<name="jaime"> Ooh You move well for a great beast of a woman
<name="jaime"> You shouldnt grimace before you lunge It gives away the game
<name="jaime"> Bit of a quandary for you If you kill me, you fail Lady Stark But if you dont kill me, Im going to kill you
<name="jaime"> Youre good Graceless, but good
<name="jaime"> See? If you were willing to hurt me, you might have had me there
<name="locke"> Looks like your womans getting the better of you, if you can call that a woman
<name="jaime"> We enjoy a good fight Gets our juices flowing The Flayed Man of House Bolton A bit gruesome for my taste
<name="locke"> You sure hes the one?
<name="man"> Thats him, all right I saw him fight at the tourney for Ser Willem Freys wedding
<name="locke"> Give the man his silver
<name="jaime"> Let us go and my father will pay you whatever you want

<name="roose"> Ser Jaime isnt well Take him to Qyburn
<name="jaime"> Will I die?
<name="qyburn"> No The corruption has spread I fear it must be cut away The safest course would be to take the whole arm off
<name="jaime"> Then youll die Youre no maester Wheres your chain?
<name="qyburn"> The Citadel stripped me of it They found some of my experiments too bold I can leave your upper arm, make the cut at your elbow
<name="jaime"> I dont need my right hand to kill you
<name="qyburn"> I can take away the rotting flesh and try and burn out the corruption with boiling wine
<name="jaime"> Mmm
<name="qyburn"> With any luck, that will suffice Youll need milk of the poppy
<name="jaime"> No milk of the poppy
<name="qyburn"> There will be pain
<name="jaime"> Ill scream
<name="qyburn"> Quite a bit of pain
<name="jaime"> Ill scream loudly
<name="cersei"> Lord Baelish
<name="littlefinger"> Your Grace
<name="cersei"> I wonder if I might ask you for a favor
<name="littlefinger"> Of course, Your Grace
<name="cersei"> I have reason to believe that House Tyrell do not hold the crowns best interests at heart
<name="littlefinger"> I see And have you shared these suspicions with Lord Tywin?
<name="cersei"> My fathers a practical man He appreciates facts
<name="littlefinger"> Myself, I often find them a hindrance
<name="cersei"> And he appreciates those who aid his family, as you well know Hes almost as generous to those who help us as he is unpleasant towards those who dont You have a good working relationship with the Tyrells I thought you might look into it before you leave the capital
<name="littlefinger"> I shall do my best
<name="cersei"> Thank you And your best will prove better than when I asked you to locate Arya Stark?
<name="littlefinger"> I assure you that it will
<name="olenna"> Gods, boy, thats enough Were not in a tavern
<name="podrick"> Pardon, my lady
<name="olenna"> No need to speak Are there any figs? Fetch some I always take figs midafternoon They help move the bowels To what do I owe this summons?
<name="tyrion"> Thank you for seeing me, my lady I had hoped we might discuss a few financial matters
<name="olenna"> I climbed all those steps to discuss financial matters?
<name="tyrion"> Its the royal wedding Im told you had a hand in planning it
<name="olenna"> Naturally
<name="tyrion"> Its shaping up to be a very involved affair The word extravagant has been used
<name="olenna"> What good is the word extravagant if it cant be used to describe a royal wedding?
<name="tyrion"> I understand that
<name="olenna"> Good
<name="tyrion"> But, as Master of Coin, it falls upon me to calculate the cost for the crown As of now, its a huge expense
<name="olenna"> And?
<name="tyrion"> And were at war, Lady Olenna
<name="olenna"> Oh, Id nearly forgotten
<name="tyrion"> Yes, and maintaining supply lines-
<name="olenna"> I cant think how it slipped my mind What is it, 12,000 infantrymen the Tyrell family has supplied? 2,000 in support Provisions so this city might survive the winter A million bushels of wheat Half a million bushels each of barley, oats, and rye 20,000 head of cattle 50,000 sheep You dont have to lecture me about wartime expenses Im quite familiar with them
<name="tyrion"> And we are so grateful for your contributions which are necessary for the preservation of the realm
<name="olenna"> As is a royal wedding The people are hungry for more than just food They crave distractions And if we dont provide them, theyll create their own And their distractions are likely to end with us being torn to pieces A royal wedding is much safer Wouldnt you say?
<name="tyrion"> I would
<name="olenna"> And traditionally paid for by the royal family
<name="olenna"> I was told you were drunk, impertinent, and thoroughly debauched You can imagine my disappointment at finding nothing but a browbeaten bookkeeper Where did you go for them, Volantis?
<name="tyrion"> My lady-
<name="olenna"> Oh, very well I wont have it said that House Tyrell refuses to play its part Well pay for half the expenses and the celebrations will go on as planned Is that sufficient?
<name="tyrion"> Quite sufficient Thank you
<name="olenna"> Very good, then Thats settled Good day
<name="tyrion"> Give me that
<name="arya"> What are you doing?
<name="gendry"> Just mending Lord Berics armor
<name="arya"> Why?
<name="gendry"> Im going to stay on and smith for the Brotherhood
<name="arya"> Have you lost your mind? When the Lannisters find this place, you think theyll spare the smiths? Theyll cave your head in with your own helmet
<name="gendry"> The Lannisters wanted to kill me long before I joined the Brotherhood
<name="arya"> You dont have to do this
<name="gendry"> I want to They need good men
<name="arya"> Robb needs good men, too Were leaving tomorrow And then you-
<name="gendry"> What? Serve him? Ive served men my entire life I served Master Mott at Kings Landing and he sold me to the Watch I served Lord Tywin at Harrenhal, wondering every day if Id get tortured or killed Im done serving
<name="arya"> You just said you were serving Lord Beric
<name="gendry"> He may be their leader, but they chose him These men are brothers Theyre a family Ive never had a family
<name="arya"> I can be your family
<name="gendry"> You wouldnt be my family Youd be my lady
<name="martyn"> Willem Willem
<name="willem"> Is this a rescue?
<name="rickard kar"> Lannister filth! Take him! MARTYN Please, I didnt do anything Im just a squire Please-
<name="robb"> Bring them in
<name="robb"> Is that all of them? It took five of you to murder two unarmed squires?
<name="rickard kar"> Not murder, Your Grace Vengeance
<name="robb"> Vengeance? Those boys didnt kill your sons I saw Harrion die on the battlefield and Torrhen-
<name="rickard kar"> Was strangled by the Kingslayer They were his kin
<name="robb"> They were boys! Look at them
<name="rickard kar"> Tell your mother to look at them She killed them as much as I
<name="robb"> My mother had nothing to do with this This was your treason
<name="rickard kar"> Its treason to free your enemies In war, you kill your enemies Did your father not teach you that, boy?
<name="robb"> Leave him
<name="rickard kar"> Aye Leave me to the king He wants to give me a scolding before he sets me free Thats how he deals with treason Our King in the North Or should I call him the King Who Lost the North?
<name="robb"> Escort Lord Karstark to the dungeon Hang the rest
<name="man"> Mercy, sire! I didnt kill anyone I only watched for the guards
<name="robb"> This one was only the watcher Hang him last so he can watch the others die
<name="man"> Please! Please, no They made me do it! They made me! They made me
<name="edmure"> Word of this cant leave Riverrun They were Tywin Lannisters nephews The Lannisters pay their debts They never stop talking about it
<name="robb"> Would you make me a liar as well as a murderer?
<name="edmure"> It wouldnt be lying We will bury them and remain silent until the war is done
<name="robb"> Im not fighting for justice if I dont serve justice to murderers in my ranks, no matter how highborn He has to die
<name="catelyn"> arstarks are Northmen They wont forgive the killing of their lord
<name="talisa"> Your mothers right If you do this, the Karstarks will abandon you
<name="robb"> You tended to their wounds You brought them supper Now theyre dead
<name="talisa"> And more boys will keep dying until this war is over You need Karstark men to end it
<name="catelyn"> Spare his life Keep him as a hostage
<name="edmure"> A hostage Tell the Karstarks that as long as they remain loyal, he will not be harmed
<name="rickard kar"> The blood of the First Men flows through my veins as much as yours, boy I fought the Mad King for your father I fought Joffrey for you We are kin Stark and Karstark
<name="robb"> That didnt stop you from betraying me And it wont save you now
<name="rickard kar"> I dont want it to save me I want it to haunt you to the end of your days
<name="robb"> Kneel, my lord
<name="robb"> Rickard Karstark, Lord of Karhold, here in sight of gods and men, I sentence you to die Would you speak a final word?
<name="rickard kar"> Kill me and be cursed You are no king of mine

<name="beric"> Do I frighten you, child?
<name="arya"> No
<name="beric"> Youre angry with me And I dont blame you But letting him go was the right thing I have more reason than most to want him hanged
<name="arya"> I thought he killed you
<name="arya"> But how?
<name="beric"> Thoros how many times have you brought me BACK?
<name="thoros"> Its the Lord of Light brings you back Im just the lucky drunk who says the words
<name="beric"> How many times?
<name="thoros"> Five, I think No, this makes six
<name="beric"> Six
<name="thoros"> There was the first time the Mountain Show her Lance right through the chest
<name="beric"> Then I was stabbed in the belly
<name="thoros"> Then it was an arrow in the back And that axe in the side
<name="beric"> Then the Lannisters caught me and executed me for treason Was it a hanging or a dagger in the eye?
<name="thoros"> Both Fuckers couldnt decide
<name="thoros"> And the Hound makes six
<name="beric"> Second time Ive been killed by a Clegane
<name="thoros"> Youd think youd learn Its not getting any easier, you know
<name="beric"> I know Every time I come back, Im a bit less Pieces of you get chipped away
<name="arya"> Could you bring back a man without a head? Not six times Just once
<name="thoros"> I dont think it works that way, child
<name="beric"> He was a good man, Ned Stark Hes at rest now, somewhere I would never wish my life upon him
<name="arya"> I would Youre alive
<name="selyse"> Lord, cast your light upon me Protect me in the darkness Burn away my sins Help me serve you Use me as you will For the night is dark and full of terrors

<name="stannis"> Selyse Ive broken a sacred vow Ive sinned
<name="selyse"> No
<name="stannis"> Ive wronged you I have shamed you
<name="selyse"> Youre doing gods work
<name="stannis"> You dont understand The Red Woman the Lady Melisandre-
<name="selyse"> I know, Stannis The Lady Melisandre has told me everything No act done in service of the Lord of Light can ever be a sin When she told me, I wept with joy
<name="selyse"> Oh, my sweet boys Petyr, Tommard, Edric I thank god every day for bringing Melisandre to us She gave you a son I gave you nothing
<name="stannis"> Thats not true
<name="selyse"> So youve come to see her as well? There is no need You must keep away from such distractions
<name="stannis"> Shes my daughter I want to see her
<name="selyse"> You are a king You dont need my permission
<name="shireen"> Under the sea I know, I know/ Oh, oh
<name="ohcut to"> Insid s room
<name="shireen"> The birds have scales / And the fish take wing / I know, I know / Oh, oh
<name="oh stannis"> Shireen
<name="shireen"> Father
<name="stannis"> Youve grown since I last saw you
<name="shireen"> Mother said you fought in a battle Did you win?
<name="stannis"> No
<name="shireen"> Did the Onion Knight come back with you?
<name="stannis"> He fought bravely
<name="shireen"> He hasnt come to visit me He said hed bring me back a present from the capital
<name="stannis"> He wont be visiting, child
<name="shireen"> Why not? Hes my friend Look
<name="shireen"> He made this for me But dont tell Mother I have it Its a secret Mother doesnt like the Onion Knight
<name="stannis"> Ser Davos is a traitor Hes rotting in a dungeon cell for his crime Best forget him
<name="jaime"> Not so hard Youll scrub the skin off
<name="brienne"> What are you doing here?
<name="jaime"> I need a bath Help me out of these rags
<name="jaime"> Now get out
<name="brienne"> Theres another tub
<name="jaime"> This one suits me fine Dont worry Im not interested If I faint, pull me out I dont intend to be the first Lannister to die in a bathtub
<name="brienne"> Why should I care how you die?
<name="jaime"> You swore a solemn vow, remember? Youre supposed to get me to Kings Landing in one piece Not going so well, is it? No wonder Renly died with you guarding him
<name="jaime"> That was unworthy Forgive me You protected me better than most-
<name="brienne"> Dont you mock me
<name="jaime"> Im apologizing Im sick of fighting Lets call a truce
<name="brienne"> You need trust to have a truce
<name="jaime"> I trust you
<name="jaime"> There it is Theres the look Ive seen it for 17 years on face after face You all despise me Kingslayer Oathbreaker A man without honor Youve heard of wildfire?
<name="brienne"> Of course
<name="jaime"> The Mad King was obsessed with it He loved to watch people burn, the way their skin blackened and blistered and melted off their bones He burned lords he didnt like He burned Hands who disobeyed him He burned anyone who was against him Before long, half the country was against him Aerys saw traitors everywhere So he had his pyromancer place caches of wildfire all over the city beneath the Sept of Baelor and the slums of Flea Bottom Under houses, stables, taverns Even beneath the Red Keep itself Finally, the day of reckoning came Robert Baratheon marched on the capital after his victory at the Trident But my father arrived first with the whole Lannister army at his back, promising to defend the city against the rebels I knew my father better than that Hes never been one to pick the losing side I told the Mad King as much I urged him to surrender peacefully But the king didnt listen to me He didnt listen to Varys who tried to warn him But he did listen to Grand Maester Pycelle, that grey, sunken cunt You can trust the Lannisters, he said The Lannisters have always been true friends of the crown So we opened the gates and my father sacked the city Once again, I came to the king, begging him to surrender He told me to bring him my fathers head Then he turned to his pyromancer Burn them all, he said Burn them in their homes Burn them in their beds Tell me, if your precious Renly commanded you to kill your own father and stand by while thousands of men, women, and children burned alive, would you have done it? Would you have kept your oath then?
<name="jaime"> First, I killed the pyromancer And then when the king turned to flee, I drove my sword into his back Burn them all, he kept saying Burn them all I dont think he expected to die He he meant to burn with the rest of us and rise again, reborn as a dragon to turn his enemies to ash I slit his throat to make sure that didnt happen Thats where Ned Stark found me
<name="brienne"> If this is true why didnt you tell anyone? Why didnt you tell Lord Stark?
<name="jaime"> Stark? You think the honorable Ned Stark wanted to hear my side? He judged me guilty the moment he set eyes on me By what right does the wolf judge the lion? By what right?
<name="brienne"> Help! Help! ingslayer
<name="jaime"> Jaime My name is Jaime
<name="shireen"> Onion Knight Ser Onion Knight
<name="davos"> Princess? Gods, what are you doing here?
<name="shireen"> Shh, youll wake Bert
<name="davos"> Bert?
<name="shireen"> Hes the fat one Hes on guard duty tonight He likes to drink wine and sleep a lot
<name="davos"> Go back to your room Youre not supposed to be here If your father knew-
<name="shireen"> he said you Were a traitor Are you?
<name="davos"> I am, child I disobeyed my king, your father, and now Im paying the price
<name="shireen"> I dont care Youre my friend You must get bored down here I brought you something to read Its about Aegon and his dragons Aegon used to live here Did you know that? And the Targaryens built this castle
<name="davos"> Aye So they did
<name="shireen"> You can hide the book under your cloak Its a good one Ill bring you more
<name="davos"> Thank you, my lady Im sure its a fine book, but its wasted on me
<name="shireen"> Take it I have more
<name="davos"> My lady, I cant read the words
<name="shireen"> You cant?
<name="shireen"> Ill teach you Ill come when Berts on duty and teach you
<name="davos"> No No No
<name="shireen"> Its easy Itll be fun
<name="davos"> Go We cant
<name="shireen"> Why not? What will they do, lock us in cells?
<name="davos"> I wouldnt know where to start
<name="shireen"> At the beginning This word is Aegon When you see A, E, and G together like that, it sounds like egg And the title of the whole book is An History of Aegon the Conqueror and His Conquest of Westeros
<name="jorah"> It was a bitch of a siege
<name="barristan"> Mm, you were first through the breach at Pyke?
<name="jorah"> The second Thoros of Myr went in alone, waving that flaming sword of his
<name="barristan"> Thoros of Myr Bloody madman Robert knighted you after the battle?
<name="jorah"> Proudest moment of my life One knee in the dust, the kings sword on my shoulder, listening to the words In the name of the Warrior, I charge you to be brave All I could think of was how badly I had to piss
<name="jorah"> In full plate metal for 16 hours Never occurred to me till the fighting was over I was very nearly the first man knighted to piss on the kings boots
<name="barristan"> Robert would have laughed He was a good man, a great warrior And a terrible king I burned away my years fighting for terrible kings
<name="jorah"> You swore an oath
<name="barristan"> Yes And a man of honor keeps his vows, even if hes serving a drunk or a lunatic Just once in my life before its over, I want to know what its like to serve with pride, to fight for someone I believe in Do you believe in her?
<name="jorah"> With all my heart
<name="daenerys"> These are the ones?
<name="missandei"> Yes, khaleesi The officers
<name="daenerys"> You did not choose this life But you are free men now And free men make their own choices Have you selected your own leader from amongst your ranks?
<name="daenerys"> Remove your helmet GREY
<name="worm"> This one has the honor
<name="daenerys"> What is your name?
<name="grey worm"> Grey Worm
<name="daenerys"> Grey Worm
<name="missandei"> All Unsullied boys are given new names when they are cut Grey Worm, Red Flea, Black Rat Names that remind them what they are vermin
<name="daenerys"> From this day forward you will choose your own names You will tell your fellow soldiers to do the same Throw away your slave name Choose the name your parents gave you, or any other A name that gives you pride
<name="grey worm"> Grey Worm gives me pride It is a very lucky name The name this one was born with was cursed That was the name he had when he was taken as a slave But Grey Worm is the name this one had the day Daenerys Stormborn set him free
<name="jorah"> King Robert wanted her dead
<name="barristan"> Of course he wanted her dead Shes a Targaryen The last Targaryen
<name="jorah"> I suppose no one on the small council could speak sense to him
<name="barristan"> I didnt sit on the small council
<name="jorah"> No? Doesnt the Lord of the Kingsguard traditionally-
<name="barristan"> Traditionally, yes, but I killed a dozen of Roberts friends during his rebellion
<name="barristan"> He didnt want advice on how to govern from a man who had fought for the Mad King Cant say I minded much I always hated the politics
<name="jorah"> Yeah, I imagine I would, too Hours spent jabbering about backstabbings and betrayals the world over
<name="barristan"> Mm-hmm
<name="jorah"> Still, shell have to wade through that muck if she wants to rule the Seven Kingdoms
<name="barristan"> Shell have good men around her to advise her, men with experience
<name="jorah"> Which men do you have in mind?
<name="barristan"> Forgive me, Ser Jorah, for what Im about to say, but your reputation in Westeros has suffered over the years
<name="jorah"> It suffered for a reason I sold men into slavery
<name="barristan"> I dont know if your presence by her side will help our cause when we go home
<name="jorah"> Our cause? Forgive me, Ser Barristan, but I was busy defending the khaleesi against King Roberts assassins while you were still bowing to the man
<name="barristan"> We both want her to rule Am I wrong?
<name="jorah"> You only joined us a few days ago I cant speak to your intentions
<name="barristan"> If were truly her loyal servants, we will do whatever needs to be done, no matter the cost, no matter our pride
<name="jorah"> Youre not Lord here Youre just another exile And I take my orders from the queen
<name="talisa"> Come to bed
<name="robb"> You were right
<name="robb"> arstarks are gone Almost half our forces Tywin Lannister knows what he needs to do to make us unravel Nothing Only wait
<name="talisa"> Dont let him
<name="robb"> What can I do? Attack Kings Landing? Theres nothing hed like better Hed crush us in a day
<name="talisa"> We could ride north Take your land back from the Greyjoys Wait out the winter
<name="robb"> Winter could last five years Once my bannermen are home again, sitting by the fire, surrounded by their families, warm and safe, theyll never ride south again When I gathered my lords together, we had a purpose, a mission Now were like a band of bickering children
<name="talisa"> Give them a new purpose
<name="robb"> What?
<name="talisa"> Oh, I dont know I dont even know where Winterfell is
<name="robb"> Here And were here Kings Landing-
<name="talisa"> What is it?
<name="robb"> I cant force them to meet us in the field and I cant attack them where theyre strongest, but I can attack them where theyre not
<name="robb"> And Casterly Rock cant run away Im going to take their home away from them
<name="talisa"> Can you do it?
<name="robb"> I need men to replace the Karstarks who marched home There is only one person in this kingdom with that kind of army who hasnt already sided with the Lannisters The man whose daughter I was supposed to marry Walder Frey
<name="sansa"> Hes such a splendid fighter Do you have any idea when we might
<name="margaery"> Ill plant the seed as soon as Joffrey and I are married It should grow quickly
<name="sansa"> Joffrey wont let me leave Hes got too many reasons to keep me here
<name="margaery"> And only one to let you go Because it will please me
<name="loras"> Squire
<name="olyvar"> Well fought, ser
<name="loras"> That was no fight I dont know you
<name="olyvar"> Olyver, if it please you
<name="olyvar"> I should like to see you spar with a proper partner, ser
<name="loras"> How did you know?
<name="olyvar"> Know what?
<name="loras"> That I wanted to
<name="loras"> My lord Ill have you know Im to be married soon and even my intended hasnt the slightest notion
<name="olyvar"> They rarely do, in my experience
<name="loras"> You have a good deal of experience, do you?
<name="olyvar"> With the husbands
<name="littlefinger"> That didnt take long
<name="olyvar"> Well, it took long enough It seems our Knight of Flowers is engaged to be wed
<name="littlefinger"> Is he? And whos the lucky girl?
<name="littlefinger"> She may not be the grandest ship in the world or the fastest, but shes mine Ive always wanted a ship Now I want a dozen Strange, isnt it?
<name="sansa"> What is?
<name="littlefinger"> It doesnt matter what we want, once we get it, then we want something else Your hair is different
<name="sansa"> Is it?
<name="littlefinger"> Lady Margaery wears it that way
<name="sansa"> Many ladies wear it this way
<name="littlefinger"> I have good news Ill be leaving the city soon
<name="sansa"> You still want me to come with you?
<name="littlefinger"> Its not a question of what I want Its what you want You want to go home, dont you?
<name="sansa"> Of course More than anything But maybe it would be better to wait Ive been thinking how dangerous it would be Not just for me, but for you Youve been so kind Id feel terrible if anything happened to you I cant tell you how touched I am by your concern for my welfare
<name="littlefinger"> I hope you know that Im your friend, Sansa Your true friend
<name="sansa"> I do, Lord Baelish
<name="littlefinger"> Petyr
<name="sansa"> Petyr
<name="littlefinger"> If you wish to stay, then of course you will stay
<name="littlefinger"> Well speak again when I return
<name="tywin"> Youre late
<name="tyrion"> Whats she doing here?
<name="tywin"> Our business concerns her, too Sit
<name="tyrion"> Youll be pleased to learn that after one conversation with Olenna Tyrell, Ive saved the crown hundreds of thousands on this wedding
<name="tywin"> Never mind that now We have something important to discuss
<name="tyrion"> Im Master of Coin Saving money is important
<name="tyrion"> Stop that Youre making me uncomfortable
<name="tywin"> Your sister has learned that your new friends the Tyrells are plotting to marry Sansa Stark to Ser Loras
<name="tyrion"> Very well Shes a lovely girl Missing some of Loras favorite bits, but Im sure theyll make do
<name="tywin"> Your jokes are not appreciated
<name="tyrion"> It wasnt my best, but-
<name="tywin"> I bring them into the royal fold and this is how they repay me, by trying to steal the key to the North out from under me
<name="tyrion"> Sansa is the key to the North? I seem to remember she has an older brother
<name="tywin"> arstarks have marched home The young wolf has lost half his army His days are numbered Theon Greyjoy murdered both his brothers That makes Sansa Stark the heir to Winterfell And I am not about to hand her over to the Tyrells
<name="tyrion"> The Tyrell army is helping us to win this war Do you really think its wise to refuse them?
<name="tywin"> Theres nothing to refuse This is a plot Plots are not public knowledge And the Tyrells wont carry this one out until after Joffreys wedding We need to act first and kill this union in its crib
<name="tyrion"> And how do we do that?
<name="tywin"> We find Sansa Stark a different husband
<name="tyrion"> Wonderful
<name="cersei"> Yes, it is
<name="tyrion"> You cant mean it
<name="tywin"> I can and I do
<name="tyrion"> Joffrey has made this poor girls life miserable since the day he took her fathers head Now shes finally free of him and you give her to me? Thats cruel even for you
<name="tywin"> Do you intend on mistreating her? The girls happiness is not my concern, nor should it be yours
<name="tyrion"> Shes a child
<name="cersei"> Shes flowered, I assure you She and I have discussed it at length
<name="tywin"> There, you see? You will wed her, bed her, and put a child in her Surely youre capable of that
<name="tyrion"> And if I refuse?
<name="tywin"> You wanted to be rewarded for your valor in battle Sansa Stark is a finer reward than you could ever dare hope for And it is past time you were wed
<name="tyrion"> I was wed Or dont you remember?
<name="tywin"> Only too well
<name="cersei"> You should be thanking the gods for this This is more than you deserve
<name="tywin"> Tyrion will do as hes bid As will you
<name="cersei"> What do you mean?
<name="tywin"> Youll marry Ser Loras
<name="cersei"> I will not
<name="tywin"> The boy is heir to Highgarden Tyrion will secure the North, you will secure the Reach
<name="cersei"> No, I wont do it
<name="tywin"> Yes, you will Youre still fertile You need to marry again and breed
<name="cersei"> I am Queen Regent, not some broodmare
<name="tywin"> Youre my daughter! You will do as I command and you will marry Loras Tyrell and put an end to the disgusting rumors about you once and for all
<name="cersei"> Father, dont make me do it again, please
<name="tywin"> Not another word My children Youve disgraced the Lannister name for far too long

<name="sansa"> I hear that youre a pervert
<name="tyrion"> I am the Imp I have certain standards to maintain
<name="sansa"> We could sheep shift Lord Desmonds bed You cut a little hole in his mattress and you stuff sheep dung inside Then you sew up the hole and make his bed again His room will stink, but he wont know where its coming from
<name="tyrion"> Lady Sansa
<name="sansa"> My sister used to do that when she was angry with me And she was always angry with me

<name="tyrion"> No She is no longer yours to torment
<name="joffrey"> Everyone is mine to torment Youd do well to remember that, you little monster
<name="tyrion"> Oh, Im a monster Perhaps you should speak to me more softly, then Monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies
<name="joffrey"> I could have your tongue out for saying that
<name="cersei"> Let him make his threats Hmm? Hes a bitter little man
<name="pycelle"> Lord Tyrion should apologize immediately Unacceptable, disrespectful, and in very bad taste
<name="joffrey"> I am the king! I will punish you
<name="tywin"> Any man who must say, I am the king is no true king Ill make sure you understand that when Ive won your war for you

<name="cersei"> Come
<name="tywin"> Not you
<name="tyrion"> You just sent the most powerful man in Westeros to bed without his supper
<name="tywin"> Youre a fool if you believe hes the most powerful man in Westeros
<name="tyrion"> A treasonous statement Joffrey is king
<name="tywin"> You really think a crown gives you power?
<name="tyrion"> No I think armies give you power
<name="tywin"> Mm-hmm
<name="tyrion"> Robb Stark had one, never lost a battle, and you defeated him all the same
<name="tywin"> Mm-hmm
<name="tyrion"> Oh, I know Walder Frey gets all the credit Or the blame, I suppose, depending on your allegiance Walder Frey is many things, but a brave man? No He never would have risked such an action if he didnt have certain assurances
<name="tywin"> Which he got from me Do you disapprove?
<name="tyrion"> Im all for cheating This is war
<name="tywin"> But to slaughter them at a wedding Explain to me why it is more noble to kill 10,000 men in battle than a dozen at dinner
<name="tyrion"> So thats why you did it? To save lives?
<name="tywin"> To end the war To protect the family Do you want to write a song for the dead Starks? Go ahead, write one Im in this world a little while longer to defend the Lannisters, to defend my blood

<name="tywin"> Shall I explain to you in one easy lesson how the world works?
<name="tyrion"> Use small words Im not as bright as you
<name="tywin"> The house that puts family first will always defeat the house that puts the whims and wishes of its sons and daughters first A good man does everything in his power to better his familys position regardless of his own selfish desires
<name="tywin"> Does that amuse you?
<name="tyrion"> No, its a very good lesson Only its easy for you to preach utter devotion to family when youre making all the decisions
<name="tywin"> Easy for me, is it?
<name="tyrion"> When have you ever done something that wasnt in your interest but solely for the benefit of the family?
<name="tywin"> The day that you were born I wanted to carry you into the sea and let the waves wash you away Instead, I let you live And I brought you as my son Because youre a Lannister
<name="tyrion"> Sansa
<name="meera"> Its empty
<name="jojen"> Lets find a place to sleep
<name="hodor"> Hodor Hodor
<name="bran"> Dont, Hodor
<name="bran"> Maybe we shouldnt stay
<name="meera"> Youd rather be out there?
<name="bran"> There are a lot of stories about this place Horrible stories
<name="jojen"> I always quite liked the horrible stories
<name="bran"> So did I Once
<name="bran"> You ever heard about the Rat Cook?
<name="meera"> No Whos he?
<name="bran"> Just a cook in the Nights Watch He was angry at the king for something, I dont remember When the king was visiting the Nightfort, the cook killed the kings son, cooked him into a big pie with onions, carrots, mushrooms and bacon That night he served the pie to the king He liked the taste of his son so much, he asked for a second slice The gods turned the cook into a giant white rat who could only eat his own young Hes been roaming the Nightfort ever since, devouring his own babies But no matter what he does, hes always hungry
<name="meera"> If the gods turned every killer into a giant white rat-
<name="bran"> It wasnt for murder the gods cursed the Rat Cook or for serving the kings son in a pie He killed a guest beneath his roof Thats something the gods cant forgive
<name="walder"> The late Walder Frey, old Hoster called me because I didnt get my men to the Trident in time for battle He thought he was witty Look at us now, Tully Youre dead, your daughter-Catelyns dead, your grandsons dead, your son spent his wedding night in a dungeon and Im Lord of Riverrun
<name="roose bolton"> The Blackfish escaped
<name="walder"> An old man on the run with no allies I have Tywin Lannister backing me Who does he have?
<name="roose bolton"> As you say
<name="walder"> They all laughed at me, all those high lords They all thought they were better than me Ned Stark, Hoster Tully People snigger when I marry a young girl, but who said a word when Jon Arryn married the little Tully bitch?
<name="roose bolton"> Youll be needing a new young girl
<name="walder"> Yeah Got that to look forward to
<name="walder"> And you, the Warden of the North No more Starks to bow and scrape to Must have been torture following that stupid boy all over the country
<name="roose bolton"> He ignored my advice at every turn If hed been a trifle less arrogant-
<name="walder"> Calling himself the Young Wolf Hows that for pomposity?
<name="walder"> Well, heres to the Young Wolf
<name="roose bolton"> Forever young
<name="walder"> Will you move to Winterfell now that the wars over?
<name="roose bolton"> At some point perhaps But Winterfells in ruins
<name="walder"> Yeah What happened up there? I heard the Greyjoy boy seized the place I heard he killed all the ravens And after that, nothing
<name="roose bolton"> I sent my bastard Ramsay to root him out Robb Stark offered amnesty for the ironborn if they gave us Theon
<name="walder"> Oh And?
<name="roose bolton"> Ramsay delivered the terms The ironborn turned on Theon as we knew they would They handed him over trussed and hooded But Ramsay well Ramsay has his own way of doing things
<name="ramsay"> Well, the girls werent lying You had a good-sized cock
<name="ramsay"> What? No Pork sausage You think Im some sort of savage?
<name="ramsay"> People talk about phantom limbs An amputee might have an itch where his foot used to be So Ive always wondered do eunuchs have a phantom cock?
<name="ramsay"> Next time you think about naked girls, would you feel an itch?
<name="ramsay"> Sorry I shouldnt make jokes My mother taught me not to throw stones at cripples
<name="ramsay"> But my father taught me to aim for their head
<name="theon"> Kill me
<name="ramsay"> Sorry, what?
<name="theon"> Kill me
<name="ramsay"> A little louder
<name="theon"> Kill me
<name="ramsay"> Youre no good to me dead We need you

<name="theon"> Theon Greyjoy
<name="ramsay"> Whats your name?
<name="theon"> Th Theon Greyjoy
<name="theon"> Please

<name="theon"> Reek My name is Reek
<name="bran"> Hodor

<name="sam"> Come with us There are steps carved into the south side of the Wall Hodor can carry you to the top Well walk straight to Castle Black
<name="gilly"> Come with us Theres nothing north but death
<name="sam"> If Jon is alive, then Castle Blacks where hell be Its the safest place for you
<name="jojen"> Theres nowhere safe any longer You know that
<name="sam"> What I know is what I saw And if you saw it, too, youd run the other way
<name="jojen"> You saw the white walkers and the army of the dead
<name="sam"> How do you know all that?
<name="jojen"> The Nights Watch cant stop them The kings of Westeros and all their armies cant stop them
<name="sam"> But youre going to stop them?
<name="bran"> Please, Sam I have to go north I have to

<name="bran"> Why? What are they for?
<name="sam"> Killing white walkers
<name="meera"> How do you know that?
<name="gilly"> The walker came for my Baby And Sam-
<name="meera"> But no ones killed a white walker in thousands of years
<name="sam"> Well, I suppose someone had to be the first
<name="bran"> Take it, Hodor
<name="sam"> And the archer I got lucky with one of them There are more Many more And for every one of them, the dead men, more than you could count I wish youd come with us
<name="bran"> I wish I could I really do
<name="davos"> How are you keeping?
<name="gendry"> Great Never better
<name="davos"> It was just a bit of blood
<name="gendry"> I should have known Every time a highborn asks my name, its trouble Were not really people to you, are we? Just a million different ways to get what you want
<name="davos"> Im not a highborn
<name="gendry"> She called you Ser I heard it
<name="davos"> A recent state of affairs I was born in Flea Bottom just like you
<name="gendry"> Sure, you were Youre my friend Youre here to help
<name="davos"> I lived below the Street of Flour
<name="gendry"> How far below? How close to the Red Keep were you?
<name="davos"> The shit that poured from their privy pipes flowed down the side of Aegons Hill along Tanners Row and right in front of my front door on Gin Alley
<name="gendry"> Gin Alley
<name="davos"> The Street of Steel, with your armor and your knights? Pfft You lived in the fancy part of town And here we are now Two boys from Flea Bottom in the castle of a king
<name="gendry"> Yeah, weve come a long way Were all the same, really She went to great pains to point that out to me
<name="davos"> If you mistrust fancy people so much, why were you in such a hurry to trust her?
<name="gendry"> Youre me Never been with a woman Never talked to a woman, really And then she comes at you big words, no clothes What would you have done?
<name="davos"> She does know her way around a mans head, Ill give her that
<name="gendry"> So howd you become a lord?
<name="davos"> Oh, thats a long story
<name="gendry"> Better not, then Im a bit busy
<name="davos"> Many years ago I helped King Stannis out of a difficult situation He rewarded me with a lordship And this
<name="gendry"> You see? Highborns
<name="davos"> I didnt want to be a lord I nearly didnt accept
<name="gendry"> Why did you?
<name="davos"> I did it for my son I didnt want him to step over a river of shit every time he stepped through his front door I wanted him to have a better life
<name="gendry"> Does he?
<name="davos"> Hes dead
<name="gendry"> Howd he die?
<name="davos"> Following me
<name="varys"> When did you come to this strange country?
<name="shae"> When I was 13
<name="varys"> You were only a child
<name="shae"> I stopped being a child when I was nine My mother made sure of that
<name="varys"> Youve been a good influence on our mutual friend, you know He used to drink from sundown to sunup, visit three brothels a night, gamble away his fathers money Now its just the drinking
<name="shae"> And now Im his wifes servant I brush her hair and clip her nails and empty her chamber pot
<name="varys"> She is a sweet young thing None of this is her fault
<name="shae"> I love that girl I would kill for her Do you think that makes it easier for me?
<name="varys"> No, I expect not
<name="shae"> Shes young and shes beautiful and highborn
<name="varys"> We break bread with them, but that doesnt make us family Weve learned their language, but well never be their countrymen If you let yourself believe that a foreign girl with no name could spend her life with the son of Tywin Lannister-
<name="shae"> I have a name
<name="varys"> You have one name As do I Here only the family name matters
<name="shae"> What do you want from me, Lord Varys?
<name="varys"> Diamonds Id tell you to beware carrying so much wealth, but you know how to protect yourself Get on one of those ships Sail to Pentos or Lys or Myr You can buy a house with these diamonds, a very large house Hire servants Start a new life, a good life, far from here The mysterious foreign beauty Youll have suitors lining up
<name="shae"> Why do you want me to leave?
<name="varys"> Tyrion Lannister is one of the few people alive who could make this country a better place He has the mind for it, he has the will, he has the right last name And you you are a complication I know you love him And I know its true love not bought by gold and silver Im not asking you to leave him for money Im asking you to leave because your presence in the capital endangers him This will never be your home, my lady Find a true home somewhere far from here while theres still time
<name="shae"> Lord Varys
<name="shae"> If he wants me to leave, he can tell me himself
<name="tyrion"> Keep up
<name="podrick"> I dont think I can, my lord
<name="tyrion"> Its not easy being drunk all the time Everyone would do it if it were easy
<name="cersei"> Leave
<name="cersei"> So, enjoying married life? An unhappy wife is a wine merchants best friend
<name="tyrion"> She doesnt deserve this
<name="cersei"> Deserve? Be careful with that Start trying to work out who deserves what and before long youll spend the rest of your days weeping for each and every person in the world
<name="tyrion"> Theres nothing worse than a late-blooming philosopher
<name="tyrion"> Will you be facing your marriage to Ser Loras with the same philosophical spirit?
<name="cersei"> I wont be marrying Ser Loras
<name="tyrion"> I seem to remember saying something similar about my own marriage
<name="cersei"> Youre not me You want to make things better for Sansa? Give her a child
<name="tyrion"> So you can tell Father it was you who finally talked me into it?
<name="cersei"> So she can have some happiness in her life
<name="tyrion"> You have children How happy would you say you are?
<name="cersei"> Not very But if it werent for my children, Id have thrown myself from the highest window in the Red Keep Theyre the reason Im alive
<name="tyrion"> Even Joffrey?
<name="cersei"> Even Joffrey He was all I had once Before Myrcella was born I used to spend hours looking at him His wisps of hair His tiny little hands and feet He was such a jolly little fellow You always hear the terrible ones were terrible babies We should have known Even then we should have known Its nonsense Whenever he was with me, he was happy And no one can take that away from me, not even Joffrey how it feels to have someone Someone of your own
<name="tyrion"> How long does it go on?
<name="cersei"> Until weve dealt with all our enemies
<name="tyrion"> Every time we deal with an enemy, we create two more
<name="cersei"> Then I suppose it will go on for quite a long time
<name="frey soldier"> Im telling you, thats what she did Sounded like a cow in heat
<name="frey soldier"> Aye, not for long
<name="frey soldier"> Thats right Black Walder shut her up right quick None of the Starks had much to say about the end of that meal
<name="frey soldier"> Ill tell you what, though The hardest thing was getting that wolfs head to stay on the body
<name="frey soldier"> You sewed it on?
<name="frey soldier"> I did
<name="frey soldier"> I bet there were 1,000 men claiming they were the one
<name="frey soldier"> It was me And Malcolm and Talbott Well, the thing was so heavy, it fell off the first time Took the skin right with it What we ended up having to do was hook the needle right under the collarbone Give it a nice firm mooring and-
<name="frey soldier"> What do you want?
<name="arya"> Mind if I keep warm?
<name="frey soldier"> Fuck off
<name="arya"> But Im hungry
<name="frey soldier"> Does fuck off mean something different where youre from?
<name="arya"> Ive got money
<name="frey soldier"> What kind of coin is that?
<name="arya"> Its worth a lot
<name="arya"> Sorry
<name="frey soldier"> Little shit
<name="frey soldier"> Fool
<name="sandor"> Where did you get the knife?
<name="arya"> From you
<name="sandor"> Is that the first man youve killed?
<name="arya"> The first man
<name="sandor"> Next time youre going to do something like that, tell me first
<name="arya"> Valar morghulis
<name="jon"> Ygritte, you know I didnt have a choice You always knew who I was, what I am
<name="jon"> I have to go home now I know you wont hurt me
<name="ygritte"> You know nothing, Jon Snow
<name="jon"> I do know some things I know I love you
<name="jon"> I know you love me But I have to go home now and spurs his horse YGRITTE has found her resolve She notches another arrow She tracks him and shoots him a third time as he gallops away She begins to weep
<name="sam"> I know how this must look What I meant was-
<name="gilly"> I swear to you, my lord-
<name="maester aemon"> Im not a lord, my dear Not for many, many years Every man who joins the Nights Watch renounces all former titles Among other things What is your name?

<name="gilly"> His name is Sam
<name="maester aemon"> Tarly do you remember the oath you swore when you joined this order?
<name="sam"> Hes not my child, Maester Aemon Shes one of Crasters wives I remember every word of the oath Night gathers and my watch begins I am the shield that guards the realms of men The realms of men That means her as well as us We didnt build 500 miles of ice walls 700 feet high to keep men out The night is gathering, Maester Aemon Ive seen it Its coming for all of us
<name="maester aemon"> Gilly, you and your son will be our guests for the time being We certainly cannot send you back beyond the Wall
<name="gilly"> Thank you Maester I can cook and clean and I can-

<name="davos"> Well, your fathers not going to go to that
<name="shireen"> My books are better than these boring scrolls You could read about Balerion the Dread They say you can still see his skull in the dungeons beneath the Red Keep Id like to see that someday
<name="davos"> Ive been trying to stay out of those dungeons my whole life
<name="shireen"> His fangs were as long as bastard swords
<name="davos"> Aye, old Balerions definitely better than anything your cousin Rylenes got on offer But now that Im your fathers Hand again, I have to keep him informed The king does not have time for this drudgery To all the lords and knobble men of Westeros
<name="shireen"> Noblemen
<name="davos"> Noblemen of Westeros, the Nig the Nights Watch implores
<name="shireen"> What is it?
<name="shireen"> Why are they ringing the bells? Are we being attacked?
<name="davos"> Stay here Bar the door
<name="stannis"> The usurper Robb Stark is dead Betrayed by his bannerman
<name="davos"> And you take credit because you dropped a leech into the fire?
<name="melisandre"> I take no credit I have faith and my faith has been rewarded
<name="davos"> Your Grace, the world has got so far bent Ive seen things crawl out of nightmares, but my eyes were open I dont know if Robb Stark died because of the Red Womans sorcery or because at war men die all the time, but I do know that uniting the Seven Kingdoms with blood magic is wrong It is evil And you are not an evil man
<name="stannis"> Do you know who had this table carved and painted, Ser Davos?
<name="davos"> Aegon Targaryen
<name="stannis"> And do you know how Aegon Targaryen conquered Westeros?
<name="davos"> On the back of his dragon Balerion the Dread
<name="stannis"> He had a smaller fleet than the kings he faced and a smaller army, but he had three dragons Dragons are magic, Ser Davos My enemies have made my kingdom bleed I will not forget that I will not forgive that I will punish them with any arms at my disposal
<name="davos"> You do not need to burn the boy If what you say is true, a drop of his blood killed Robb Stark-
<name="melisandre"> And our king is still no closer to the Iron Throne A great gift requires a great sacrifice
<name="davos"> His name is Gendry Hes a good lad A poor lad from Flea Bottom who happens to be your nephew
<name="stannis"> What is the life of one bastard boy against a kingdom?
<name="davos"> Everything
<name="stannis"> The boy must die
<name="gendry"> What are you doing?
<name="davos"> Youre leaving
<name="gendry"> Is this some kind of trick?
<name="davos"> Yes, but not on you
<name="davos"> Aim for that star Dont stop Theres bread and water Go slow with it If you finish it off, no matter how thirsty you get, dont drink seawater

<name="gendry"> Where should I go?
<name="davos"> You must keep the coast on your left side until you reach Kings Landing
<name="gendry"> The gold cloaks are looking for me
<name="davos"> They were looking for me for 20 years Do they know your face?

<name="melisandre"> You saved one innocent How many tens of thousands have you doomed?
<name="davos"> There has got to be another way
<name="stannis"> What other way?! Tell us about this other way
<name="davos"> I dont know, Your Grace I cant see the future in the fire

<name="stannis"> When did you learn to read?
<name="davos"> Matthos taught me before he died so I could be of better service to you
<name="melisandre"> This War of Five Kings means nothing The true war lies to the north, my king Death marches on the Wall Only you can stop him
<name="davos"> You cant stop him alone You need someone to rebuild your army for you, someone to convince this lord and that lord to fight for you, to bring sellswords and pirates to your side
<name="stannis"> Ive made my decision
<name="melisandre"> Hes right You need him He has a part to play in the war to come
<name="stannis"> You see, Ser Davos? Youve been saved by that fire god you like to mock Youre in his army now

<name="barristan"> Your Grace, allow me to present the captains of the Second Sons Mero of Braavos, Prendahl na Ghezn, and-
<name="daario"> Daario Naharis
<name="mero"> You are the Mother of Dragons? I swear I fucked you once in a pleasure house in Lys
<name="jorah"> Mind your tongue
<name="mero"> Why? I didnt mind hers She licked my ass like she was born to do it
<name="mero"> You, slave girl, bring wine
<name="daenerys"> We have no slaves here
<name="mero"> Youll all be slaves after the battle unless I save you Take your clothes off and come and sit on Meros lap and I may give you my Second Sons
<name="daenerys"> Give me your Second Sons and I may not have you gelded Ser Barristan, how many men fight for the Second Sons?
<name="barristan"> Under 2,000, Your Grace
<name="daenerys"> We have more, dont we?
<name="barristan"> 10,000 Unsullied
<name="daenerys"> Im only a young girl, new to the ways of war, but perhaps a seasoned captain like yourself can explain to me how you propose to defeat us
<name="daario"> I hope the old man is better with a sword than he is with a lie You have 8,000 Unsullied
<name="daenerys"> Youre very young to be a captain
<name="prendahl"> Hes not a captain Hes a lieutenant
<name="daenerys"> Even if your numbers are right, you must admit the odds dont favor your side
<name="mero"> The Second Sons have faced worse odds and won
<name="jorah"> The Second Sons have faced worse odds and run
<name="daenerys"> Or you could fight for me
<name="mero"> Weve taken the slavers gold We fight for Yunkai
<name="daenerys"> I would pay you as much and more
<name="prendahl"> Our contract is our bond If we break our bond, no one will hire the Second Sons again
<name="daenerys"> Ride with me and youll never need another contract Youll have gold and castles and lordships of your choosing when I take back the Seven Kingdoms
<name="daario"> You have no ships You have no siege weapons You have no cavalry
<name="daenerys"> A fortnight ago, I had no army A year ago, I had no dragons You have two days to decide
<name="mero"> Show me your cunt I want to see if its worth fighting for
<name="grey worm"> My Queen, shall I slice out his tongue for you?
<name="daenerys"> These men are our guests You seem to be enjoying my wine Perhaps youd like a flagon to help you ponder
<name="mero"> Only a flagon? And what are my brothers in arms to drink?
<name="daenerys"> A barrel, then
<name="mero"> Good The Titans Bastard does not drink alone In the Second Sons, we share everything After the battle, maybe well all share you
<name="mero"> Ill come looking for you when this is over
<name="daenerys"> Ser Barristan, if it comes to battle, kill that one first
<name="barristan"> Gladly, Your Grace
<name="stannis"> Half Robert, half lowborn
<name="melisandre"> Show the boy to his chambers Have the maids draw him a bath and find him some decent clothes Ill come visit you soon
<name="stannis"> What do you mean to do with him?
<name="melisandre"> You know what I mean to do with him
<name="stannis"> Then why bathe him and dress him in fine clothes? If it needs to be done, do it Dont torture the boy
<name="melisandre"> Have you ever slaughtered a lamb, my king?
<name="stannis"> No
<name="melisandre"> If the lamb sees the knife, she panics Her panic seeps into her meat, darkens it, fouls the flavor
<name="stannis"> Youve slaughtered many lambs?
<name="melisandre"> And none have seen the blade
<name="davos"> And tho and thowg V-v-visenya Targaryen rod rode Vhagar Vhag Fuck me Visenya Targaryen rode Vhagar, the smallest of the dragons, though still large enog enough enough to swallow a horse whole
<name="davos"> Your Grace
<name="stannis"> They feeding you enough?
<name="davos"> Two meals a day Cold for breakfast, hot for supper I cannot complain
<name="stannis"> You dont belong in a place like this
<name="davos"> Well, its sad to say, but Ive seen worse
<name="stannis"> Yeah
<name="davos"> Im sorry about your son Didnt get the chance to tell you before Good lad Loyal lad
<name="stannis"> Melisandres returned
<name="davos"> I didnt know shed been gone
<name="stannis"> Came back with a bastard boy Roberts bastard boy
<name="davos"> Why?
<name="stannis"> She says theres power in kings blood
<name="davos"> Shes going to kill him
<name="stannis"> Sacrifice him
<name="davos"> Forgive me, Your Grace, Im not a learned man, but is there a difference between kill and sacrifice? The boy is your nephew
<name="stannis"> What of it? Were at war Why should I spare the son of some tavern slut Robert bedded one drunken night?
<name="davos"> Because he has your blood in his veins
<name="stannis"> So did Renly
<name="davos"> Renly wronged you Renly declared himself king when the throne belonged to you He raised an army, stole your bannermen This boy has done you no harm Hes an innocent
<name="stannis"> How many boys live in Westeros? How many girls? How many men? How many women?The darkness will devour them all, she says The night that never ends Unless I triumph I never asked for this No more than I asked to be king We do not choose our destiny, but we must do our duty, no? Great or small, we must do our duty Whats one bastard boy against a kingdom?
<name="davos"> Your Grace, why did you come to see me today?
<name="stannis"> I came to free you If you swear never to raise your hand to the Lady Melisandre again
<name="davos"> I swear it I cant swear never to speak against her
<name="stannis"> You have little regard for your own life
<name="davos"> Quite little, Your Grace Verging on none You could have freed me yesterday or tomorrow, but you came to me now before this boy is put to the knife because you knew Id counsel restraint You came to hear me say it because you believe it yourself Youre not a man who slaughters innocents for gain or glory When my son was five he said to me, I dont ever want to die I wanted to say to him, You wont, child You wont ever I hated the idea of him lying awake in the dark, afraid I think mothers and fathers made up the gods because they wanted their children to sleep through the night
<name="stannis"> I saw a vision in the flames A great battle in the snow I saw it And you saw whatever she gave birth to I never believed, but when you see the truth, when its right there in front of you as real as these iron bars, how can you deny her god is real?
<name="prendahl"> Little dragon bitch She talks too much
<name="daario"> You talk too much
<name="mero"> She wont talk so much when shes choking on my cock
<name="daario"> 8000 unsullied stand between her and your cock
<name="mero"> My cock will find a way Tell him Is there any place that my cock cant reach?
<name="daario"> Shell tell me whatever you pay her to tell me
<name="mero"> Daario Naharis, the whore who doesnt like whores
<name="daario"> I like them very much I just refuse to pay them And Im no whore, my friend
<name="mero"> She sells her sheath and you sell your blade Whats the difference?
<name="daario"> I fight for beauty
<name="prendahl"> For beauty?
<name="mero"> We fight for gold
<name="daario"> The gods gave men two gifts to entertain ourselves before we die the thrill of fucking a woman who wants to be fucked and the thrill of killing a man who wants to kill you
<name="mero"> Youll die young
<name="prendahl"> What do we do about the dragon girl? We cant beat 8,000 Unsullied on the battlefield
<name="mero"> There wont be a battle And we dont have to deal with her eunuchs We only have to deal with her
<name="prendahl"> Shes well guarded
<name="mero"> Tonights a new moon One of us slips into her camp past her Unsullied and her knights
<name="prendahl"> Which one of us?
<name="mero"> Close your eyes, love
<name="mero"> Three coins A coin from Meereen, a coin from Volantis, and a coin from Braavos The Braavosi does the deed One for each of us, darling No peeking
<name="daario"> Do you hear me? Follow my voice Im right here
<name="daario"> You have something for me?
<name="daario"> Valar morghulis
<name="tyrion"> Lady Sansa
<name="sansa"> You look very handsome, my lord
<name="tyrion"> Oh, yes The husband of your dreams But you do look glorious Perhaps we could have a moment alone Do you mind? Podrick, could you escort Lady Starks handmaiden?
<name="tyrion"> My lady, I want you to know I didnt ask for this
<name="sansa"> I hope I will not disappoint you, my lord
<name="tyrion"> No, dont You dont have to speak to me as a prisoner anymore You wont be a prisoner after today Youll be my wife I suppose thats a different kind of prison I just wanted to say Im just trying to say very badly I just just want to say I know how you feel
<name="sansa"> I doubt that very much, my lord
<name="tyrion"> Youre right I have no idea how you feel And you have no idea how I feel
<name="tyrion"> But I promise you one thing, my lady I wont ever hurt you Do you drink wine?
<name="sansa"> When I have to
<name="tyrion"> Well, today you have to
<name="margaery"> You look radiant, Your Grace
<name="cersei"> Radiant? Why radiant?
<name="margaery"> Its the word that came to mind
<name="margaery"> Were going to be sisters soon We should be friends
<name="cersei"> Youre a musical girl, arent you? I imagine you have a lovely voice
<name="margaery"> A better dancer than a singer, Im afraid
<name="cersei"> Ah, but you know the song The Rains of Castamere?
<name="margaery"> Of course They play it so often here at court
<name="cersei"> So you know the story of House Reyne of Castamere?
<name="margaery"> Not as well as you, Im sure
<name="cersei"> House Reyne was a powerful family Very wealthy The second wealthiest in Westeros Arent the Tyrells the second wealthiest family in Westeros now?
<name="cersei"> Of course, ambitious climbers dont want to stop on the second highest rung If only you could take that final step, youd see further than all the rest Youd be alone with nothing but blue sky above you So Lord Reyne built a castle as grand as Casterly Rock He gave his wife diamonds larger than any my mother ever wore And finally one day, he rebelled against my father Do you know where House Reyne is now?
<name="margaery"> Gone
<name="cersei"> Gone A gentle word Why not say slaughtered? Every man, woman, and child put to the sword
<name="cersei"> I remember seeing their bodies hanging high above the gates of Casterly Rock My father let them rot up there all summer It was a long summer And now the rains weep oer their halls, and not a soul to hear
<name="cersei"> If you ever call me sister again, Ill have you strangled in your sleep
<name="sansa"> What are you doing?
<name="joffrey"> Your fathers gone As the father of the realm, it is my duty to give you away to your husband
<name="high septon"> You may now cloak the bride and bring her under your protection
<name="tyrion"> Could you
<name="tyrion"> Thank you
<name="high septon"> Your Grace, Your Grace, my lords, my ladies, we stand here in the sight of gods and men to witness the union of man and wife One flesh, one heart, one soul, now and forever
<name="melisandre"> Have you ever seen one like it?
<name="gendry"> Ive never seen anything like any of this Not in my life
<name="melisandre"> Its shocking, isnt it, the first time you encounter real wealth? When I was your age, I lived on one bowl of stew a day And stew is a kind word for it
<name="gendry"> In Flea Bottom we called them bowls of brown Wed pretend that the meat in them was chicken We knew it wasnt chicken
<name="melisandre"> Here, taste this
<name="melisandre"> You think Im trying to poison you?
<name="gendry"> Thats good
<name="gendry"> Thats really good
<name="melisandre"> Where do you think its from?
<name="gendry"> I couldnt even guess
<name="melisandre"> Doesnt matter, does it? Its the real thing or its not You only need a tongue to tell the difference Go on, have some more You still dont trust it You think this is all a mistake and that youll have to pay somehow for every bite you take
<name="gendry"> That thought had crossed my mind, yeah
<name="melisandre"> There are no mistakes Not for us
<name="gendry"> Im a mistake Im only here because my father grabbed my mother instead of the girl next to her in the tavern
<name="melisandre"> Your father chose your mother because the Lord of Light willed it He willed it so you could be here right now with a power inside you you cant even begin to understand And He brought me here to draw it from you and birth it into the world Were both a part of His plan He wants this for us No, He demands this of us
<name="gendry"> I dont understand This this doesnt seem very religious
<name="melisandre"> According to whom? The Silent Sisters? With their stern looks, muzzled mouths, and dried-up cunts? What have their gods done for you? Hmm? When you pray to them, whats their answer? A god is real or hes not You only need eyes to see
<name="melisandre"> Death is coming for everyone and everything A darkness that will swallow the dawn And we can stop it, you and I
<name="melisandre"> Let me show you what you have inside you Come fight death with me
<name="gendry"> What are you doing?
<name="melisandre"> You have to trust me
<name="gendry"> What ? Get it away Get it off me
<name="melisandre"> Dont fight, dont fight They wont take much
<name="gendry"> Why are you doing this?
<name="melisandre"> I told you theres power in the blood of kings And you have so much blood
<name="gendry"> No No, no, no, no! Not there Not there
<name="melisandre"> You can blame Ser Davos He didnt believe in the power of kings blood He wanted a demonstration
<name="gendry"> Please Please, Your Grace My lord
<name="stannis"> The usurper Robb Stark The usurper Balon Greyjoy The usurper Joffrey Baratheon JOFFREY and CERSEI sit amist the festivities drinking wine and chatting TYWIN sits to their left, stoic At the head table, TYRION carefully fills his wine glass right to the brim He smacks his lips and looks over to SANSA, who is disgusted with him The Tyrells sit across the hall from the Lannisters speaks with amusement to LORAS and MARGAERY
<name="olenna"> So their son will be your nephew After youre wed to Cersei, of course And you will be the kings stepfather and brother-in-law When you marry the king, Joffreys mother will become his sister-in-law and your son will be Loras nephew? Grandson? Im not sure But your brother will become your father-in-law That much is beyond dispute
<name="sansa"> Will you pardon me, my lord?
<name="tyrion"> Of course Of course En enjoy
<name="cersei"> Perhaps you could talk to your bride-to-be instead
<name="joffrey"> Ive got a lifetime for that
<name="cersei"> Stay
<name="tywin"> You seem rather drunk
<name="tyrion"> Rather less than I plan to be Isnt it a mans duty to be drunk at his own wedding?
<name="tywin"> This isnt about your wedding Renly Baratheon had a wedding Your wife needs a child, a Lannister child, as soon as possible
<name="tyrion"> And?
<name="tywin"> If youre going to give her one, you need to perform
<name="tyrion"> What did you once call me? A drunken little lust-filled beast
<name="tywin"> More than once
<name="tyrion"> There you have it Nothing to worry about Drinking and lust, no man can match me in these things I am the god of tits and wine I shall build a shrine to myself at the next brothel I visit
<name="tywin"> You can drink, you can joke, you can engage in juvenile attempts to make your father uncomfortable, but you will do your duty
<name="loras"> Well, my father once told me-
<name="cersei"> Nobody cares what your father once told you
<name="joffrey"> Congratulations, my lady
<name="sansa"> Thank you, Your Grace
<name="joffrey"> Well, youve done it Youve married a Lannister Soon youll have a Lannister baby Its a dream come true for you, isnt it? What a glorious day
<name="sansa"> Yes, Your Grace
<name="joffrey"> I suppose it doesnt really matter which Lannister puts the baby into you Maybe Ill pay you a visit tonight after my uncle passes out Howd you like that?
<name="joffrey"> You wouldnt? Thats all right Ser Meryn and Ser Boros will hold you down
<name="joffrey"> Time for the bedding ceremony
<name="tyrion"> There will be no bedding ceremony
<name="joffrey"> Wheres your respect for tradition, Uncle? Come, everyone Pick her up and carry her to her wedding bed Get rid of her gown She wont be needing it any longer Ladies, attend to my uncle Hes not heavy
<name="tyrion"> There will be no bedding ceremony
<name="joffrey"> There will be if I command it
<name="tyrion"> Then youll be fucking your own bride with a wooden cock
<name="joffrey"> What did you say? What did you say?
<name="tywin"> I believe we can dispense with the bedding, Your Grace Im sure Tyrion did not mean to threaten the king
<name="tyrion"> A bad joke, Your Grace Made out of envy of your own royal manhood Mine is so small My poor wife wont even know Im there
<name="tywin"> Your uncle is clearly quite drunk, Your Grace
<name="tyrion"> I am Guilty But but it is my wedding night
<name="tyrion"> My tiny drunk cock and I have a job to do Come, wife
<name="tyrion"> I vomited on a girl once in the middle of the act Not proud of it But I think honesty is important between a man and wife, dont you agree? Come, Ill tell you all about it Put you in the mood
<name="sansa"> Is that wise, my lord?
<name="tyrion"> Tyrion, Sansa My name is Tyrion
<name="sansa"> Is that wise, Tyrion?
<name="tyrion"> Nothing was ever wiser
<name="tyrion"> Astoundingly long
<name="sansa"> What?
<name="tyrion"> Neck You have one How old are you exactly?
<name="tyrion"> Well, talk wont make you any older My lord father has commanded me to consummate this marriage
<name="tyrion"> Stop I cant I could, I wont
<name="sansa"> But your father-
<name="tyrion"> If my father wants someone to get fucked, I know where he can start I wont share your bed Not until you want me to
<name="sansa"> What if I never want you to?
<name="tyrion"> And so my watch begins
<name="missandei"> Yes, Your Grace
<name="daenerys"> How can anyone speak 19 languages?
<name="missandei"> It only took Your Grace a year to learn Dothraki reasonably well
<name="daenerys"> Yes, well, it was either learn Dothraki or grunt at my husband and hope what do you mean reasonably well?
<name="missandei"> Dothraki is difficult for the mouth to master So guttural and harsh
<name="daenerys"> Drogo said I spoke Dothroaki like one born to it It gave him great pride
<name="missandei"> Athjahakar
<name="daenerys"> Athjahaka
<name="missandei"> Ath-ja-hakar
<name="daenerys"> Athjahakar
<name="daenerys"> Well, I suppose Im a bit out of practice
<name="missandei"> Your High Valyrian is very good, Your Grace The gods could not devise a more perfect tongue It is the only proper language for poetry
<name="daario"> No screaming or she dies
<name="daenerys"> What do you want?
<name="daario"> You
<name="daenerys"> Let her go
<name="daario"> Dont scream, lovely girl
<name="daenerys"> You were sent here to kill me?
<name="daenerys"> So why havent you?
<name="daario"> I dont want to
<name="daenerys"> What do your captains have to say about that?
<name="daario"> You should ask them
<name="daenerys"> Why?
<name="daario"> We had philosophical differences
<name="daenerys"> Over what?
<name="daario"> Your beauty It meant more to me than it did to them
<name="daenerys"> Youre a strange man
<name="daario"> Im the simplest man youll ever meet I only do what I want to do
<name="daenerys"> And this is supposed to impress me?
<name="daario"> Yes
<name="daenerys"> Why would I trust a man who murders his comrades?
<name="daario"> They ordered me to murder you I told them I preferred not to They told me I had no choice I told them I am Daario Naharis I always have a choice They drew their swords and I drew mine
<name="daenerys"> Will you fight for me?
<name="daenerys"> Swear to me
<name="daario"> The Second Sons are yours and so is Daario Naharis My sword is yours, my life is yours, my heart is yours
<name="tyrion"> You really ought to knock
<name="shae"> I brought your breakfast
<name="sam"> Its getting dark We could stay here for the night
<name="sam"> How hard can it be to build a fire?
<name="gilly"> It doesnt matter Come under the furs We can keep each other warm
<name="sam"> He winked at me before
<name="gilly"> I doubt it
<name="sam"> I saw him wink at me
<name="gilly"> He blinked
<name="sam"> I suppose its a rather philosophical difference between a wink and a blink
<name="gilly"> A what?
<name="sam"> Well, I mean, theres no real difference
<name="gilly"> A wink is on purpose
<name="sam"> You thought of a name yet? It would be easier to refer to him if he had a name
<name="gilly"> Sometimes do you talk fancy on purpose to confuse me?
<name="sam"> What? No This is just the way I talk
<name="gilly"> Ill build that fire
<name="sam"> Dont you think he should have a name?
<name="gilly"> I dont know many boys names
<name="sam"> Lets see, theres Duncan, Kevan, Jon Guymon, Feldan, Tristifer
<name="gilly"> Craster
<name="sam"> Uh, yes Maybe thats not-
<name="gilly"> Mormont
<name="sam"> Thats a lovely idea, but Mormonts a last name
<name="gilly"> Why is it a last name?
<name="sam"> Well, its a family name For instance, Im Samwell Tarly Samwell is my birth name and Tarly is my family name You see? So my father is also a Tarly
<name="gilly"> His name is Samwell Tarly, too?
<name="sam"> No, Randyll Tarly
<name="gilly"> Randyll is a handsome name
<name="sam"> Please dont name him Randyll
<name="gilly"> Is your father cruel like mine?
<name="sam"> Different manner of cruel
<name="gilly"> Not Randyll, then
<name="gilly"> Dont Dont go out there
<name="sam"> Ill be back I just want to look
<name="sam"> Go inside Go back inside Ill-

<name="orell"> You would if you were mine Id tell you that youre beautiful and fierce and wild Id be good to you You love him?
<name="orell"> Cause hes pretty? Is that it? You like his pretty hair and his pretty eyes? You think pretty is gonna make you happy?
<name="ygritte"> Dont touch me

<name="margaery"> What is it, then? Hes rather good-looking even with the scar Especially with the scar
<name="sansa"> Hes a dwarf And Loras Loras
<name="margaery"> Some women like tall men Some like short men Some like hairy men Some like bald men Gentle men, rough men, ugly men, pretty men, pretty girls Most women dont know what they like until theyve tried it And, sadly, so many of us get to try so little before were old and gray Tyrion may surprise you From what Ive heard, hes quite experienced
<name="sansa"> And thats a good thing?
<name="margaery"> It can be Were very complicated, you know Pleasing us takes practice
<name="sansa"> How do you know all this? Did your mother teach you?
<name="margaery"> Yes, sweet girl My mother taught me
<name="tyrion"> Shes a child
<name="bronn"> Shes a foot taller than you
<name="tyrion"> A tall child
<name="bronn"> Whats the youngest youve ever had?
<name="tyrion"> Not that young
<name="bronn"> How much older?
<name="tyrion"> Older
<name="bronn"> Youre a lord, shes a lady And a beauty at that I dont see the problem
<name="tyrion"> Shae isnt going to like it
<name="bronn"> Shae is a whore Are you gonna marry her? Eh? How did marrying a whore work out for you the first time?
<name="tyrion"> I should never have told you about that
<name="bronn"> You want Shae, keep her Wed one and bed the other All you have to do is get a son in the Stark girl Hell be Lord of Winterfell one day You can rule the North in his name Youll have two women and a whole kingdom of your own
<name="tyrion"> Two women to despise me and a whole kingdom to join them
<name="bronn"> You waste time trying to get people to love you, youll end up the most popular dead man in town You want to fuck that Stark girl You just dont want to admit it
<name="tyrion"> I dont pay you to put evil notions in my head The ones already there dont need company
<name="bronn"> You pay me to kill people who bother you Evil notions come free
<name="tywin"> Your Grace
<name="joffrey"> Grandfather
<name="tywin"> You wanted to speak to me?
<name="joffrey"> Yes Id like a report on the meetings of my small council
<name="tywin"> Youre welcome to attend the meetings of your small council, Your Grace Any or all of them
<name="joffrey"> Ive been very busy Many important matters require a kings attention
<name="tywin"> Of course
<name="joffrey"> Youve been holding the council meetings in the Tower of the Hand instead of the small council chamber
<name="tywin"> I have, yes
<name="joffrey"> May I ask why?
<name="tywin"> The Tower of the Hand is where I work To walk from there to here would take time, time I could otherwise spend productively
<name="joffrey"> So if I wanted to attend a council meeting, I would now have to climb all the stairs in the Tower of the Hand?
<name="tywin"> We could arrange to have you carried
<name="joffrey"> Tell me about the Targaryen girl in the east and her dragons
<name="tywin"> Where did you hear about this?
<name="joffrey"> Is it true?
<name="tywin"> Apparently so
<name="joffrey"> Dont you think we ought to do something about it?
<name="tywin"> When I was Hand of the King under your fathers predecessor, the skulls of all the Targaryen dragons were kept in this room The skull of the last of them was right here It was the size of an apple
<name="joffrey"> And the biggest was the size of a carriage
<name="tywin"> Yes, and the creature to whom it belonged died 300 years ago Curiosities on the far side of the world are no threat to us
<name="joffrey"> But how do we know these dragons are just curiosities and not the beasts that brought the whole world to heel?
<name="tywin"> Because we have been told as much by the many experts who serve the realm by counseling the king on matters about which he knows nothing
<name="joffrey"> But I havent been counseled
<name="tywin"> You are being counseled at this very moment
<name="joffrey"> I should be consulted about such things
<name="tywin"> From now on, I will see to it that you are appropriately consulted on important matters whenever necessary Your Grace
<name="jorah"> Yunkai The Yellow City
<name="barristan"> The Yunkish train bed slaves, not soldiers We can defeat them
<name="jorah"> On the field, with ease But they wont meet us on the field They have provisions, patience, and strong walls If theyre wise, theyll hide behind those walls and chip away at us, man by man
<name="daenerys"> I dont want half my army killed before Ive crossed the Narrow Sea
<name="jorah"> We dont need Yunkai, khaleesi Taking this city will not bring you any closer to Westeros or the Iron Throne
<name="daenerys"> How many slaves are there in Yunkai?
<name="jorah"> 200,000 if not more
<name="daenerys"> Then we have 200,000 reasons to take the city
<name="daenerys"> Send a man to the city gates Tell the slavers I will receive them here, and accept their surrender Otherwise, Yunkai will suffer the same fate as Astapor
<name="missandei"> Now comes the noble Razdal mo Eraz of that ancient and honorable house, master of men and speaker to savages, to offer terms of peace
<name="missandei"> Noble lord, you are in the presence of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains, and Mother of Dragons
<name="daenerys"> You may approach Sit
<name="missandei"> Will the noble lord take refreshment?
<name="kraznys mo nakloz"> Ancient and glorious is Yunkai Our empire was old before dragons stirred in old Valyria Many an army has broken against our walls You shall find no easy conquest here, khaleesi
<name="daenerys"> Good My Unsullied need practice I was told to blood them early
<name="radzal mo eraz"> If blood is your desire, blood shall flow But why? Tis true you have committed savageries in Astapor But the Yunkai are a forgiving and generous people
<name="radzal mo eraz"> The wise masters of Yunkai have sent a gift for the silver queen
<name="radzal mo eraz"> There is far more than this awaiting you on the deck of your ship
<name="daenerys"> My ship?
<name="radzal mo eraz"> Yes, khaleesi As I said, we are a generous people You shall have as many ships as you require
<name="daenerys"> And what do you ask in return?
<name="radzal mo eraz"> All we ask is that you make use of these ships Sail them back to Westeros where you belong and leave us to conduct our affairs in peace
<name="daenerys"> I have a gift for you as well Your life
<name="radzal mo eraz"> My life?
<name="daenerys"> And the lives of your wise masters But I also want something in return You will release every slave in Yunkai Every man, woman, and child shall be given as much food, clothing, and property as they can carry as payment for their years of servitude Reject this gift, and I shall show you no mercy
<name="radzal mo eraz"> You are mad We are not Astapor or Qarth We are Yunkai and we have powerful friends Friends who would take great pleasure in destroying you Those who survive, we shall enslave once more Perhaps well make a slave of you as well
<name="radzal mo eraz"> You swore me safe conduct
<name="daenerys"> I did, but my dragons made no promises And you threatened their mother
<name="radzal mo eraz"> Take the gold
<name="daenerys"> My gold You gave it to me, remember? And I shall put it to good use Youd be wise to do the same with my gift to you Now get out
<name="barristan"> The Yunkish are a proud people They will not bend
<name="daenerys"> And what happens to things that dont bend? He said he had powerful friends Who was he talking about?
<name="jorah"> I dont know
<name="daenerys"> Find out
<name="shae"> Chains?
<name="tyrion"> Solid gold from the mines outside Lannisport Smithed in Casterly Rock
<name="shae"> Golden chains
<name="tyrion"> You could buy a ship with these
<name="shae"> Do I need a ship?
<name="tyrion"> What?
<name="shae"> Am I going somewhere?
<name="tyrion"> Of course youre not going anywhere
<name="shae"> So, am I invited to your wedding?
<name="tyrion"> I didnt ask for this marriage I didnt want it
<name="shae"> No? Shes a beautiful girl You said so yourself
<name="tyrion"> That doesnt mean that this is duty, not desire
<name="shae"> Is that what you will tell yourself when you fuck her?
<name="tyrion"> I dont have a choice My father-
<name="shae"> Does not rule the world We can still go across the Narrow Sea
<name="tyrion"> What would I do there? Juggle? I am a Lannister of Casterly Rock
<name="shae"> And Im Shae the funny whore
<name="tyrion"> My feelings for you have not changed I will marry Sansa Stark and do my duty by her
<name="shae"> While I empty her chamber pot and lick your cock when youre bored?
<name="tyrion"> I swear to you it will not be like that
<name="shae"> No? What will it be like?
<name="tyrion"> I will buy you a good home somewhere in the city You will have fine clothes, guards to keep you safe, servants Any children we might have will be well provided for
<name="shae"> Children? You think I want children who can never see their father? Who would be killed in their sleep if their grandfather found out about them?
<name="tyrion"> Listen Listen to me, my lady
<name="shae"> Im not your lady
<name="tyrion"> You are Youll always be my lady
<name="shae"> Im your whore And when you are tired of fucking me, I will be nothing

<name="ygritte"> They must have been great builders, stacking stones so high
<name="jon"> Winterfell has towers three times that size
<name="ygritte"> Im Jon Snow and Im from Winterfell My daddy was a fancy lord and I lived in a tower that touched the clouds
<name="jon"> If youre impressed by a windmill, youd be swooning if you saw the Great Keep at Winterfell

<name="ygritte"> And how do you know that?
<name="jon"> Every boy in the North knows it We grow up learning it Where the battles were fought, the names of the heroes, who died where Six times youve invaded and six times youve failed The seventh will be the same
<name="ygritte"> Mance is different
<name="jon"> You dont have the discipline You dont have the training Your army is no army You dont know how to fight together

<name="jojen"> Thats where we are
<name="osha"> What are you telling him?
<name="bran"> Its all right, Osha
<name="osha"> Its not all right You think I cant hear you every day? Filling his head with black magic Talking about visions and three-eyed ravens and worse
<name="meera"> Leave him alone
<name="osha"> He can speak for himself
<name="jojen"> I dont fill his head with anything
<name="osha"> So what do you talk about?
<name="jojen"> Whats happening to him and what that means
<name="osha"> Go on, then Tell us what it means
<name="jojen"> Its not like that I wish I could tell him all the answers It would be much easier
<name="osha"> I dont want you talking to him anymore Until we get to your brother at Castle Black
<name="jojen"> Were not going to Castle Black
<name="osha"> What did you say?
<name="jojen"> I told you already Jon Snow isnt there Bran needs to find the raven beyond the Wall
<name="osha"> Oh, no Im not going back there Your brother is at Castle Black Thats where were going Look at me
<name="bran"> The ravens been coming to me ever since I fell from that tower He wants me to find him I dont have my legs anymore This is what I have now
<name="osha"> You have a family You need to go back to Castle Black so you can get back to them where you belong
<name="bran"> What if I belong in the North? What if I fell from that tower for a reason?
<name="osha"> Is that what hes telling you? That its all for a reason? All these bad things happened because the gods got big plans for you? I wish it were true, little lord But the gods wouldnt spare a ravens cold shit for you or me or anyone
<name="bran"> You dont understand You dont know
<name="osha"> You dont know None of you know None of you have been up there I had a man once A good man Bruni, his name was I was his and he was mine But one night Bruni disappears People said he left me, but I knew him Hed never leave me Not for long
<name="osha"> I knew hed come back And he did He came in through the back of the hut Only it wasnt Bruni Not really His skin was pale like a dead mans His eyes bluer than clear sky He came at me, grabbed me by the neck and squeezed so hard I could feel the life slipping out of me I dont know how I got the knife When I did, I stuck it deep into his heart And he hardly seemed to notice I had to burn our hut down with him inside I didnt ask the gods what it meant I didnt need to I already knew It meant the North was no place for men to be Not anymore I promised your maester Id get you to Castle Black and no further
<name="qyburn"> How is the pain, my lord?
<name="jaime"> Whats the purpose of an arm with no hand?
<name="qyburn"> Well, weve stymied the corruption
<name="jaime"> Yes, weve stymied the corruption Youre a learned man
<name="qyburn"> All the good its done me
<name="jaime"> You did well sewing up this mess Youre far better at this sort of work than Grand Maester Pycelle
<name="qyburn"> Faint praise, my lord
<name="jaime"> So why did the Citadel take your chain? Did you fondle one boy too many?
<name="qyburn"> No, my lord Thats not my weakness
<name="jaime"> What is?
<name="qyburn"> Curiosity The only way to treat disease is to understand disease And the only way to understand it is to study the afflicted
<name="jaime"> You performed experiments on living men
<name="qyburn"> On dying men
<name="jaime"> With their permission?
<name="qyburn"> My studies have given me insight that has saved many lives
<name="jaime"> Dying paupers, I assume Men with no families to complain You found them moaning in the poorhouse and had them carted back to your garret and opened up their bellies to see what was inside
<name="qyburn"> How many men have you killed, my lord?
<name="jaime"> I dont know
<name="qyburn"> 50? 100?
<name="qyburn"> Countless
<name="jaime"> Countless has a nice ring to it
<name="qyburn"> And how many lives have you saved?
<name="jaime"> Half a million The population of Kings Landing You were in charge of the ravens at Harrenhal Did you did you get a bird off to Briennes father in Tarth?
<name="qyburn"> A bird flew off and a bird flew back Lord Selwyn Tarth offered 300 gold dragons for his daughters safe return
<name="jaime"> A fair offer
<name="qyburn"> A fair offer Locke wont take it
<name="jaime"> Why not?
<name="qyburn"> Hes convinced Lord Tarth owns all the sapphire mines in Westeros
<name="qyburn"> He feels hes being cheated
<name="jaime"> Theyd be fools to kill her
<name="qyburn"> These men have been at war a long time Most of them will be dead by winter Shell be their entertainment tonight Beyond tonight, I dont think they care very much
<name="jaime"> We have to return to Harrenhal
<name="steelshanks walton"> Why?
<name="jaime"> Ive left something behind
<name="steelshanks walton"> Absolutely not Ive got orders from Lord Bolton
<name="jaime"> And what are those orders?
<name="steelshanks walton"> To deliver you to your father at Kings Landing
<name="jaime"> You think youll get a reward
<name="steelshanks walton"> I serve Lord Bolton Any appreciation your father-
<name="jaime"> You think youre getting a reward Let me explain something to you When my father sees me, the first thing hes going to ask is what happened to my hand And Im going to tell him this man chopped it off
<name="steelshanks walton"> I had nothing-
<name="jaime"> Or I could tell him this man saved my life We return to Harrenhal now
<name="jaime"> Whoa
<name="steelshanks walton"> Eyes open, lads
<name="jaime"> Be quiet
<name="men"> The bear, the bear and the maiden fair / From there to here, from here to there All black and brown and covered in hair He smelled that girl in the summer air The bear, the bear, and the maiden fair
<name="man"> Dont spare her Dont spare her
<name="locke"> Well, this is one shameful fucking performance Stop running and fight
<name="jaime"> A wooden sword?
<name="locke"> I thought youd gone
<name="jaime"> You gave her a wooden sword
<name="locke"> Weve only got one bear
<name="jaime"> Ill pay her bloody ransom Gold, sapphires, whatever you want Just get her out of there
<name="locke"> All you lords and ladies still think that the only thing that matters is gold
<name="locke"> This makes me happier than all your gold ever could And that makes me happier than all her sapphires So go buy yourself a golden hand and fuck yourself with it
<name="brienne"> Ah
<name="jaime"> Get behind me
<name="brienne"> I will not
<name="locke"> What the fuck are you doing to my bear?
<name="steelshanks walton"> Lord Bolton charged me with bringing him back to Kings Landing alive and thats what I aim to do
<name="jaime"> Pull her up
<name="brienne"> Hold my legs
<name="brienne"> Pull him up
<name="locke"> The bitch stays
<name="jaime"> Were taking her to Kings Landing Unless you kill me
<name="locke"> She belongs to me Lord Boltons orders
<name="jaime"> What do you think is more important to Lord Bolton? Getting his pet rat a reward or ensuring Tywin Lannister gets his son back alive?

<name="meera"> Well, some of us would say thank you when someone else hunts down their breakfast for them Or dont they teach you to say thank you north of the Wall?
<name="osha"> Youve got a big mouth, girl, and too many teeth
<name="bran"> Stop it
<name="hodor"> Hodor

<name="osha"> Lady Reed heres got a stick so far up her ass, its a wonder her feet touch the ground
<name="bran"> Youve been nasty to her every day Of course shes nasty back
<name="osha"> Me? Its my fault? First time I met her, she put a knife to my throat
<name="bran"> First time I met you, you held a knife at me We cant fight each other Well never make it to the Wall I want you both to make peace
<name="meera"> Your way of skinning rabbits is quicker than mine
<name="osha"> I said so, didnt I?
<name="bran"> Osha

<name="meera"> The visions take their toll
<name="bran"> Hes having one now?
<name="jojen"> I saw Jon Snow
<name="bran"> You saw him? At Castle Black?
<name="jojen"> He was on the wrong side of the Wall surrounded by enemies
<name="tormund"> Used to be you couldnt find a tree within a mile of the Wall Crows would come out every morning with axes
<name="orell"> Your flock gets smaller every year

<name="ygritte"> I brought a pair for you Theyre too big for you, but theyre good
<name="jon"> You kill someone for them?
<name="ygritte"> Nah I didnt kill him, but I bet his balls are still bruised
<name="ygritte"> He wasnt good to me the way youre good to me He didnt do that thing you do with your tongue
<name="jon"> Can we not talk about that here?
<name="ygritte"> Can we not talk about that here? Im Jon Snow Ive killed dead men and Qhorin Halfhand, but Im scared of naked girls
<name="jon"> Did I seem scared the other day?
<name="ygritte"> You were trembling like a leaf
<name="jon"> Only in the beginning
<name="ygritte"> Only in the beginning Youre a proper lover, Jon Snow And dont worry Your secrets safe with me
<name="jon"> What secret?
<name="ygritte"> Do you think Im as dumb as all those girls in silk dresses you knew growing up? Youre loyal and youre brave You didnt stop being a crow the day you walked into Mance Rayders tent
<name="ygritte"> But Im your woman now, Jon Snow Youre going to be loyal to your woman The Nights Watch dont care if you live or die Mance Rayder dont care if I live or die Were just soldiers in their armies and theres plenty more to carry on if we go down
<name="ygritte"> Its you and me that matters to me and you Dont ever betray me
<name="jon"> I wont
<name="ygritte"> Cause Ill cut your pretty cock right off and wear it round my neck
<name="tormund"> Sink your metal deep and make sure it holds before taking your next step And if you fall, dont scream You dont want that to be the last thing she remembers
<name="arya"> Joffrey Cersei Ilyn Payne
<name="anguy"> Youre good Youre not as good as you think you are
<name="arya"> Face, tits, balls I hit em right where I wanted to

<name="arya"> Never aim?
<name="anguy"> Your eye knows where it wants the arrow to go Trust your eye
<name="arya"> Theres someone out there
<name="anguy"> Thats about far enough
<name="melisandre"> We come as friends
<name="anguy"> Begging your pardon, mlady, but well be the judge of that
<name="melisandre"> Valar morghulis
<name="thoros"> Valar dohaeris I dont see many priestesses of Rhollor in the Riverlands
<name="melisandre"> You are Thoros of Myr
<name="melisandre"> The High Priest gave you a mission Turn King Robert away from his idols and towards the Lord of Light What happened?
<name="thoros"> I failed
<name="melisandre"> You quit, you mean The heathen continue to slaughter each other and you continue to get drunk
<name="thoros"> You worship Him in your way, and Ill worship Him in mine Do you speak the common tongue?
<name="thoros"> My friends here dont speak High Valyrian Why are you here, my lady?
<name="beric"> Forgive my manners I dont see many ladies these days
<name="thoros"> Lucky for the ladies
<name="melisandre"> How many times has the Lord brought him back?
<name="thoros"> Six
<name="melisandre"> Thats not possible
<name="thoros"> The Lord has smiled upon me
<name="melisandre"> You should not have this power
<name="thoros"> I have no power I ask the Lord for His favor, and He responds as He will
<name="thoros"> Ive always been a terrible priest Drank too much rum Fucked all the whores in Kings Landing Its a terrible thing to say, but by the time I came to Westeros, I didnt believe in our Lord I decided that He, that all the gods, were stories we told the children to make them behave So I wore the robes and every now and then Id recite the prayers, but it was just for show A spectacle for the locals Until the Mountain drove a lance through this ones heart I knelt beside his cold body and said the old words Not because I believed in them, but he was my friend and he was dead And they were the only words I knew And for the first time in my life, the Lord replied Berics eyes opened and I knew the truth Our god is the one true god And all men must serve Him
<name="melisandre"> Youve been to the other side
<name="beric"> The other side? There is no other side I have been to the darkness, my lady He sent you to us for a reason
<name="melisandre"> You have someone He needs
<name="anguy"> Bodkin point Penetrates plate at 200 yards Can you make em?
<name="gendry"> Yeah, nothing tricky about it Just need decent steel
<name="anguy"> Ill get you the steel
<name="man"> Come on
<name="arya"> I dont like that woman
<name="anguy"> Thats cause youre a girl
<name="arya"> What does that have to do with anything?
<name="beric"> Forgive me, lad
<name="arya"> What are you doing? Let go of him
<name="arya"> Tell them to stop Come on He wants to be one of you He wants to join the Brotherhood Stop them
<name="beric"> We serve the Lord of Light and the Lord of Light needs this boy
<name="arya"> Did the Lord of Light tell you that or did she?
<name="arya"> Youre not doing this for your god Youre doing it for gold
<name="thoros"> Were doing it for both, girl We cant defend the people without weapons and horses and food And we cant get weapons and horses and food without gold
<name="gendry"> You told me this was a Brotherhood You told me I could be one of you
<name="melisandre"> You are more than they can ever be Theyre just foot soldiers in the great war You will make kings rise and fall
<name="arya"> Youre a witch Youre going to hurt him
<name="melisandre"> I see a darkness in you And in that darkness, eyes staring back at me brown eyes, blue eyes, green eyes Eyes youll shut forever We will meet again
<name="ygritte"> You staring at my ass, Jon Snow?
<name="tormund"> Look out
<name="ygritte"> You all right?
<name="tormund"> Just seeing if you can take a hit, lad
<name="ramsay"> Sorry Were you sleeping?
<name="theon"> Wa-
<name="ramsay"> Wa ? Wa ? Water? You want some water I wish I had some for you
<name="ramsay"> So lets play a game Which body part do you need the least?
<name="theon"> Please
<name="ramsay"> Please is not a body part
<name="theon"> Ill tell you everything, please
<name="ramsay"> But youve already told me everything Remember? Your daddy was mean to you The Starks didnt appreciate you One good bit, though The Stark boys, theyre still alive Wouldnt that be a hunt to remember? You failed, but Im a better hunter than you
<name="ramsay"> Now how about your little finger? You dont use that for much, do you? No? Good Lets start with that
<name="ramsay"> Youve been wondering why youre here Havent you? Where you are Who I am Why Im doing this to you So guess If you guess right, Ill tell you By the old gods and the new, I swear it You win the game if you can figure out who I am and why Im torturing you and I win the game if you beg me to cut off your finger
<name="theon"> If I win, youll let me go?
<name="ramsay"> If you think this has a happy ending, you havent been paying attention
<name="theon"> Please
<name="ramsay"> You say please again and youll wish you hadnt You first Where are we?
<name="theon"> The North
<name="ramsay"> Too vague
<name="theon"> Deepwood Motte
<name="ramsay"> Terrible guess
<name="ramsay"> Now, where?
<name="theon"> Last Hearth
<name="ramsay"> Do I look like a fucking Umber to you?
<name="theon"> Karhold
<name="ramsay"> Karhold? How did you know that? Did you see any banners flying when we came in?
<name="theon"> No It was just a guess
<name="ramsay"> Very good, Lord Theon And who am I?
<name="theon"> Torrhen Karstark
<name="ramsay"> Hes dead Strangled by the Kingslayer
<name="theon"> He was your brother Your father is Lord Rickard Karstark
<name="theon"> You swore to tell me if I-
<name="ramsay"> Youre right
<name="theon"> Lord Rickard Karstark is Robb Starks bannerman I betrayed Robb Thats why youre torturing me
<name="ramsay"> Yes You win
<name="ramsay"> Of course, you forgot to ask one question You forgot to ask if Im a liar
<name="ramsay"> Im afraid I am
<name="ramsay"> Everything I told you is a lie
<name="ramsay"> This isnt happening to you for a reason Well, one reason I enjoy it
<name="theon"> Please, cut it off! Cut it off! Cut it off
<name="ramsay"> I win
<name="robb"> Thank you for riding here so quickly I know travel isnt easy in these times
<name="black walder"> The roads are crawling with cutthroats and bandits But when the King of the North summons us, we come
<name="lothar"> Our father has instructed us to tell you that his alliance with the North can continue if his terms are met Lord Frey requires a formal apology for your violation of your sacred oath to marry one of his daughters
<name="robb"> Of course He deserves as much I was in the wrong
<name="black walder"> As restitution for this betrayal, he demands Harrenhal and all its attendant lands
<name="edmure"> I dont think thats-
<name="robb"> We are fighting for the North Harrenhal is not in the North It is his once the war is over and we have no further strategic need for it
<name="black walder"> And theres something else
<name="robb"> We will do whatever we can to give Lord Frey what he needs
<name="black walder"> Not what, whom
<name="edmure"> What?
<name="edmure"> No
<name="lothar"> Our father requires Lord Edmure to wed one of his daughters Roslin
<name="edmure"> How old is she?
<name="edmure"> Could I see her first?
<name="black walder"> You want to count her teeth? We depart for the Twins in the morning We need an answer before we leave and a wedding not more than a fortnight thereafter or this alliance is at an end
<name="brynden"> Your father does realize were in the middle of a war?
<name="lothar"> Father is old It will put his heart at peace if he could see her wed to a good husband
<name="black walder"> And his recent experience has made him wary of long engagements
<name="robb"> He has every right to be Please excuse us while we discuss it
<name="edmure"> Why should I let that old ferret choose my bride for me? At the very least, I should be offered the same choice you were Im his liege lord
<name="robb"> Hes a proud man and weve wounded him
<name="edmure"> I didnt wound him My answer is no
<name="brynden"> Listen to me and listen very carefully You-
<name="edmure"> The laws of gods and men are very clear No man can compel another man to marry
<name="brynden"> The laws of my fist are about to compel your teeth
<name="robb"> Its all right You heard him If you refuse, our alliance with the Freys is dead
<name="edmure"> Hes wanted me for one of his daughters since I was 12 Hes not gonna stop wanting it now When I say no, he will come back and offer me a daughter of my choosing
<name="catelyn"> Youre willing to risk our freedom and our lives for a chance at a prettier wife?
<name="robb"> I have a war to fight We cant win it without them I have no time to haggle You said you wanted to make amends for the Stone Mill
<name="brynden"> You recall that heroic engagement?
<name="edmure"> I had something less permanent in mind
<name="robb"> Ive won every battle, but Im losing this war If we dont do this and do it now, were lost
<name="edmure"> Ill marry her
<name="robb"> Youre paying for my sins, Uncle Its not fair or right Ill remember it
<name="roose bolton"> I see my men have finally found you something appropriate to wear
<name="brienne"> Yes Most kind of them Youre a Stark bannerman, Lord Bolton I am acting on Lady Starks orders to return Jaime Lannister to Kings Landing
<name="roose bolton"> When King Robb left Harrenhal, his mother was his prisoner If she wasnt his mother, hed have hanged her for treason
<name="roose bolton"> I should send you back to Robb Stark
<name="jaime"> You should But instead, youre sitting here watching me fail at dinner Why might that be?
<name="roose bolton"> Wars cost money Many people would pay a great deal for you
<name="jaime"> We both know who would pay the most Or make you pay the most if he found out you had captured me and sent me back up north for a summary execution
<name="roose bolton"> Youre right Perhaps the safest thing to do is to kill you both and burn your bodies
<name="jaime"> It would be, if you honestly believed my father would never find out about it
<name="roose bolton"> King Robb is keeping your father quite busy He doesnt have time for anything else
<name="jaime"> Hell make time for you
<name="roose bolton"> As soon as youre well enough to travel, I will allow you to go to Kings Landing as restitution for the mistakes my soldiers made And you will swear to tell your father the truth, that I had nothing to do with your maiming
<name="jaime"> Shall we drink on it?
<name="roose bolton"> I dont partake
<name="jaime"> You do understand how suspicious that is to ordinary people?
<name="jaime"> Very well My lady, may our journey continue without further incident
<name="roose bolton"> Oh, she wont be going with you
<name="brienne"> I am charged with bringing Ser Jaime to-
<name="roose bolton"> You are charged with abetting treason
<name="jaime"> Im afraid I must insist
<name="roose bolton"> Youre in no place to insist on anything I would have hoped youd learned your lesson about overplaying your position
<name="olenna"> Impossible
<name="tywin"> Why?
<name="olenna"> My grandson is the pride of Highgarden The most desirable bachelor in all seven kingdoms Your daughter-
<name="tywin"> Is rich, the most beautiful woman in all seven kingdoms and the mother of the king
<name="olenna"> Old
<name="tywin"> Old?
<name="olenna"> Old Im something of an expert on the subject Her change will be upon her before long Ill spare you the details of what will happen then You men may have a stomach for bloodshed and slaughter, but this is another matter entirely
<name="tywin"> The years punish us as well, I promise you that My stomach remains quite strong, however The only thing that might turn it are details of your grandsons nocturnal activities Do you deny them?
<name="olenna"> Oh, not at all A sword swallower through and through
<name="tywin"> And a boy with his affliction should be grateful for the opportunity to marry the most beautiful woman in the kingdoms and remove the stain from his name
<name="olenna"> Did you grow up with boy cousins, Lord Tywin? Sons of your fathers bannermen, squires, stable boys?
<name="tywin"> Of course
<name="olenna"> And you never-
<name="tywin"> No
<name="olenna"> Not once? Not in any way?
<name="tywin"> Never
<name="olenna"> I congratulate you upon your restraint But its a natural thing, two boys having a go at each other beneath the sheets
<name="tywin"> Perhaps Highgarden has a high tolerance for unnatural behavior
<name="olenna"> I wouldnt say that True, we dont tie ourselves in knots over a discreet bit of buggery, but brothers and sisters where I come from, that stain would be very difficult to wash out
<name="tywin"> I will not breathe further life into a malicious lie by discussing it
<name="olenna"> Lie or not, you must admit many people find it quite convincing Convincing enough to put swords in their hands and send them off to kill Lannisters and Tyrells thanks to our new affiliation
<name="tywin"> I dont care what people believe And neither do you
<name="olenna"> As an authority on myself, I must disagree
<name="tywin"> Now, if the rumors about my children were true, then Joffrey is no king at all and House Tyrell is throwing its prized flower into the dirt
<name="olenna"> And if Cersei is too old to give Loras children, were throwing another prized flower into the dirt It is a chance we simply cannot take
<name="tywin"> The uncertainty makes you uncomfortable All right Ill remove it for you
<name="tywin"> If you refuse to marry Loras to Cersei, I will name him to the Kingsguard Im sure youre familiar with the Kingsguard vows He will never marry He will never have children
<name="tywin"> The Tyrell name will fade And Highgarden will go to the children of Joffrey and Margaery
<name="olenna"> You would have your grandson protected by someone who disgusts you?
<name="tywin"> I would have my grandson protected by a skilled warrior who takes his vows seriously So, shall I draw up the order? Or do you consent to this marriage?
<name="olenna"> Its a rare enough thing a man who lives up to his reputation
<name="orell"> No
<name="orell"> Weve gotta cut them loose
<name="tormund"> No! They hang and dangle helplessly far from the wall, swinging back and forth ORELL continues to cut through the rope finally swings far enough to plant his axe in solid ice At the same moment, ORELL cuts through the rope and YGRITTE plummets, limbs spinning Her fall halts when the rope t goes taught
<name="jon"> Take my hand
<name="sansa"> Thats a wonderful pin
<name="loras"> Oh, its more of a brooch, really Though I suppose a brooch is a sort of pin
<name="so sansa"> Im very happy about
<name="loras"> Uh, yes I-I am as well
<name="sansa"> I feel like Im in a dream
<name="loras"> Yes, me, too Definitely Ive dreamed of a large wedding since I was quite young The guests, the food, the tournaments And the bride, of course The most beautiful bride in the world in a beautiful gown of gold and green brocade with fringed sleeves Have you ever been to Highgarden, my lady?
<name="sansa"> No I had never left Winterfell before I came to Kings Landing But it sounds wonderful I cant wait to see it And to leave this place
<name="loras"> Its terrible, isnt it? The most terrible place there is
<name="tyrion"> I dont suppose theres anything we can do about this
<name="cersei"> We can have them both killed
<name="tyrion"> Its hard to say which of the four of us is getting the worst of this arrangement Probably Sansa Though Loras will certainly come to know a deep and singular misery
<name="cersei"> Father doesnt discriminate Were all being shipped off to hell together
<name="tyrion"> On a boat you built
<name="cersei"> The Tyrells were plotting to undermine our family I did what I did to protect our family
<name="tyrion"> Im your family A member of your family who has actively contributed to that familys survival Whether or not you or Father or anyone else wants to admit it
<name="cersei"> I do admit it If it werent for your trick with the wildfire, Stannis would have sacked the city before Father got here Our heads would still be rotting on the city gate
<name="tyrion"> Trying to have me killed is an odd way of saying thank you There are two people in Kings Landing who can give an order to a Kingsguard Did you or did you not order Ser Mandon to kill me during the Battle of the Blackwater?
<name="tyrion"> The impulse I understand He hates me because Im the only one who tells him what he really is So, fair enough He wants me dead But his stupidity? He could have had me poisoned and no one would have known But the king orders a Kingsguard to murder the Hand of the King in full view of his own army The boys an idiot
<name="cersei"> What do you want me to say?
<name="tyrion"> I want you to tell me if my life is still in danger
<name="cersei"> Probably But not from Joffrey He wont do anything now Fathers here
<name="tyrion"> Seven kingdoms united in fear of Tywin Lannister
<name="cersei"> Not the Tyrells Soon they wont need to be afraid of him Joffrey will belong to Margaery, the little doe-eyed whore And so will his children and their children History will be taken from our hands
<name="tyrion"> You may escape, at least Once Jaime gets back, Ser Loras may come down with a terrible case of sword through bowels
<name="cersei"> When Jaime gets back, yes But when do we think thats going to be? Hes out there somewhere
<name="tyrion"> Jaime or not, Im truly fucked
<name="cersei"> Whos going to tell her?
<name="sansa"> Do you think people will like it?
<name="shae"> I dont think they will even notice it
<name="sansa"> Youre right Its not my wedding Anyway, from what I can tell, the dressmakers in Highgarden will be far superior to the ones in Kings Landing Theyd never make me anything as dull as this for my wedding Loras likes green and gold brocade
<name="shae"> Im sure he does
<name="sansa"> Will they let me invite my family?
<name="shae"> They havent asked my opinion
<name="sansa"> But do you think they will?
<name="shae"> No
<name="maid"> Lady Sansa, Lord Tyrion to see you Should I-
<name="tyrion"> I beg your pardon, my lady
<name="sansa"> Good afternoon, Lord Tyrion I was just trying on a gown for King Joffreys wedding
<name="tyrion"> Yes, it should be quite a wedding I need to speak with you, Lady Sansa
<name="sansa"> Of course
<name="tyrion"> Alone, if I may
<name="shae"> Why do you need to speak to her alone?
<name="sansa"> Shae Please excuse her, Lord Tyrion Shes not from here But I trust her, even though she tells me not to
<name="tyrion"> Sometimes we think we want to hear something and its only afterwards when its too late that we realize we wished wed heard it under entirely different circumstances
<name="sansa"> Its all right, really
<name="tyrion"> How to begin? Its this this this is awkward
<name="varys"> 1000 blades taken from the hands of Aegons fallen enemies, forged in the fiery breath of Balerion the Dread
<name="littlefinger"> There arent There arent even 200 Ive counted
<name="varys"> Ha, Im sure you have Ugly old thing Yet it has a certain appeal The Lysa Arryn of chairs Shame you had to settle for your second choice
<name="littlefinger"> Early days, my friend It is flattering, really you feeling such dread at the prospect of me getting what I want
<name="varys"> Thwarting you has never been my primary ambition, I promise you Although who doesnt like to see their friends fail now and then?
<name="littlefinger"> Youre so right For instance, when I thwarted your plan to give Sansa Stark to the Tyrells If Im going to be honest, I did feel an unmistakable sense of enjoyment there But your confidant, the one who fed you information about my plans, the one you swore to protect, you didnt bring her any enjoyment And she didnt bring me any enjoyment She was a bad investment on my part Luckily, I have a friend who wanted to try something new Something daring And he was so grateful to me for providing this fresh experience
<name="varys"> I did what I did for the good of the realm
<name="littlefinger"> The realm? Do you know what the realm is? Its the thousand blades of Aegons enemies A story we agree to tell each other over and over till we forget that its a lie
<name="varys"> But what do we have left once we abandon the lie? Chaos A gaping pit waiting to swallow us all
<name="littlefinger"> Chaos isnt a pit Chaos is a ladder
<name="littlefinger"> Many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again The fall breaks them

<name="robb"> If we take Tywins castle from him, the lords of Westeros will realize hes not invincible Take his home, take his gold, take his power

<name="robb"> So, Casterly Rock? Im asking your advice
<name="catelyn"> We have enough men?
<name="catelyn"> If reinforcements arrive from Kings Landing, before we take the castle, well be caught between Tywins army and the sea
<name="robb"> Well lose the war and die the way father died Or worse

Heh Very honorable, I call it a pretty face Mmmm, very pretty Prettier than this lot, thats for sure Very shapely as well Oh, you try to hide her under that dress If you wanted to hide her, you shouldnt have brought her here in the first place
<name="walder"> I can always see whats going on beneath a dress Been at this a long time I bet when you take that dress off, everything stays right where it is Doesnt drop an inch
<name="walder"> Your king says he betrayed me for love I say he betrayed me for firm tits and a tight fit

<name="jorah"> Your men but not you?
<name="daario"> I have no interest in slaves A man cannot make love to property
<name="daario"> This is where we enter the city Very few guards, they know me They let me inside
<name="barristan"> Were not gonna sneak an army through a back gate
<name="daario"> I kill the guards I take your two best men and lead them through the back streets, which I know well, and open the front gates
<name="daario"> Then comes the army Once the walls are breached, the city will fall in hours
<name="jorah"> Or perhaps youll lead Grey Worm and me to the slaughter, cutting the head off our army The masters of Yunkai will pay you your fee and you wont have to split it three ways cause youve already slaughtered your partners
<name="daario"> You have a very suspicious mind In my experience, only dishonest people think this way
<name="jorah"> You command the Unsullied What do you think?
<name="daenerys"> Lo jention mirre numazme eza, iderenna qopsa verdagon issa
<name="grey worm"> I trust him
<name="daenerys"> You leave tonight
<name="jorah"> Very good Well prepare
<name="barristan"> Ser Jorah You can use an extra sword
<name="jorah"> Youre the Queensguard, Ser Barristan Your place is by the Queen If we are truly her loyal servants, well do whatever needs to be done No matter the cost, no matter our pride -
<name="sam"> Were west of Castle Black, but the Nightforts closest to us It was the first castle on the Wall The Watch abandoned it during the reign of King Jaehaerys I Too big, impossible to maintain Other than Castle Black itself, the Nightforts the perfect castle for us Its got a secret sally port, the Black Gate, as old as the Wall itself No ones used it for centuries, most likely It leads through the Wall right down into the Nightfort, if no one knows how to find it, which, it just so happens I do
<name="gilly"> How do you know all that?
<name="sam"> I read about it in a very old book
<name="gilly"> You know all that from staring at marks on paper?
<name="sam"> Yes
<name="gilly"> Youre like a wizard
<name="gilly"> Our father used to tell us that no wildling ever looked upon the Wall and lived Here we are Alive -
<name="sandor"> Remember what happens to children who run Im your father and Ill do the talking
<name="pig farmer"> The roads have gone right to hell, havent they? Cracked three spokes this morning
<name="sandor"> Need a hand?
<name="pig farmer"> Need about eight hands
<name="pig farmer"> Got to get this salt pork to The Twins in time for the wedding
<name="pig farmer"> Many thanks
<name="arya"> Dont! Dont kill him
<name="sandor"> Dead rats dont squeak
<name="arya"> Youre so dangerous, arent you? Saying scary things to little girls Killing little boys and old people A real hard man you are
<name="sandor"> More than anyone you know
<name="arya"> Youre wrong I know a killer A real killer
<name="sandor"> That so?
<name="arya"> Youd be like a kitten to him Hed kill you with his little finger
<name="sandor"> That him?
<name="arya"> No
<name="sandor"> Good
<name="arya"> Dont kill him! Please Please dont
<name="sandor"> Youre very kind Someday itll get you killed -
<name="osha"> Where are we?
<name="bran"> The Gift, I think Brandon The Builder gave all this land south of the Wall to the Night’s Watch for their sustenance and support Maester Luwin taught me that
<name="jojen"> Doesn’t seem to be supporting anyone at the moment
<name="meera"> It’s good land and there’s no war up here Why leave?
<name="bran"> Wildlings
<name="bran"> Sorry But they come over the Wall and raid, steal, carry off women
<name="rickon"> Old Nan said they turn your skull into a cup and make you drink your own blood from it
<name="rickon"> That’s what Old Nan said
<name="jojen"> There’s a storm coming
<name="bran"> I don’t see any
<name="meera"> It’s as good a place to shelter as any
<name="osha"> We can drink some blood while we wait I don’t need much -
<name="orell"> Only one old man and eight good horses
<name="tormund"> What’s one old man doing with eight horses?
<name="jon"> He breeds them for the Watch
<name="ygritte"> How’s he keep folks from stealing them?
<name="jon"> The Watch protects him
<name="orell"> Not today they don’t He’s selling horses, he’s got some gold in there
<name="tormund"> And proper steel
<name="orell"> Let’s carve him up
<name="jon"> We just take the horses and go The old man’s no threat
<name="orell"> I keep telling you
<name="ygritte"> He’s an old man A spear through the heart’s a better way to die than coughing up your last with no one but your horses to hear
<name="jon"> The Watch might send a few men looking for a horse thief They’ll send a lot more to hunt down murderers
<name="tormund"> I hope so Killing crows in their castle is tough Killing them out here in the open, that’s what we do
<name="tormund"> Spread out Surround the hut and move in
<name="jon"> Ygritte
<name="tormund"> Clear the barn! -
<name="arya"> No one’s going to believe you’re a hog farmer if you eat them all
<name="sandor"> Best part of the animal
<name="sandor"> Don’t worry, they’re still there
<name="arya"> I know they’re still there
<name="sandor"> You check every five minutes like you’re afraid they’re gonna move
<name="arya"> I’m not afraid
<name="sandor"> Of course you are You’re almost there and you’re afraid you won’t make it The closer you get, the worse the fear gets No point in trying to hide behind that face I know fear when I see it Seen it a lot
<name="arya"> I knew fear when I saw it in you You’re afraid of fire
<name="arya"> When Beric’s sword went up in flames, you looked like a scared little girl
<name="arya"> And I know why, too I heard what your brother did to you Pressed your face to the fire like you’re a nice juicy mutton chop
<name="sandor"> That give you some ideas?
<name="arya"> Might do
<name="sandor"> Go ahead then You might get away Might even make it there on your own They’re just over the river The closest you’ve been to family since Ilyn Payne snipped your daddy’s neck
<name="arya"> Someday I’m gonna put a sword through your eye and out the back of your skull -
<name="bran"> How are we going to get past the Wall? My uncle said it’s 700 feet high
<name="bran"> How did you get past it?
<name="osha"> Got in a boat and rowed past the Bay of Seals
<name="bran"> It would take us two months to get to the Bay of Seals
<name="osha"> Some climb straight up the ice
<name="bran"> Even Hodor’s not strong enough to climb the Wall with me on his back
<name="hodor"> Hodor
<name="jojen"> Nineteen castles guard the Wall Only three are still manned
<name="hodor"> Hodor
<name="jojen"> One of those abandoned fortresses will give us a way through
<name="bran"> My uncle said the gates were sealed with ice and stone when the castles were deserted
<name="meera"> Well, we’ll have to open them up again
<name="old man"> Whoa, whoa, whoa
<name="meera"> There’s a rider out there
<name="jojen"> Just one?
<name="meera"> There’s more
<name="hodor"> Hodor
<name="osha"> It’s just thunder, sweet giant
<name="hodor"> Hodor
<name="old man"> I yield I yield
<name="jojen"> Wildlings
<name="osha"> Where’s Shaggydog and Summer?
<name="bran"> Hunting
<name="hodor"> Hodor
<name="jojen"> Shhh, quiet, Hodor
<name="hodor"> Hodor
<name="jojen"> Make him shut up If they hear us
<name="bran"> Hush, Hodor No, no more Hodoring
<name="hodor"> Hodor
<name="bran"> Hodor, calm down
<name="osha"> You need to keep quiet
<name="jojen"> They’re gonna hear us
<name="bran"> Hodor, be quiet
<name="bran"> Hodor, calm down Hodor, be quiet
<name="meera"> What did you do?
<name="bran"> Nothing I don’t know
<name="rickon"> What’s That?
<name="osha"> That’s a horse dying
<name="wildling"> Bring them over here
<name="wildling"> That was the last of them The rest are dead
<name="orell"> I heard shouting up there
<name="tormund"> Thunder
<name="orell"> I know the difference between shouting and thunder
<name="tormund"> Maybe its ghosts
<name="tormund"> That won’t help you, grandpa
<name="tormund"> Where you riding?
<name="old man"> Doesn’t matter now, does it?
<name="tormund"> No, it doesn’t matter now
<name="orell"> Cut his throat or he’ll tell the crows we’re here
<name="tormund"> You understand
<name="old man"> Let me stand at least
<name="old man"> Let me go with a bit of dignity
<name="orell"> Make the crow kill him You’re one of us now Prove it
<name="jojen"> The wolves are out there
<name="bran"> I can’t do it by choice I don’t know how It happens in my dreams
<name="jojen"> You’re a warg, Bran It’s in your blood
<name="bran"> I can’t
<name="jojen"> You just did, with him
<name="jojen"> A wolf is nothing compared to that
<name="old man"> She looks sharp
<name="ygritte"> Do it Do it
<name="orell"> Told ya He’s still one of them
<name="tormund"> Go on, boy
<name="tormund"> Go on
<name="orell"> He’s a crow He’ll always be a crow And here’s his crow wife guarding him He’ll stab us in the back first chance he gets
<name="tormund"> Kill him
<name="tormund"> He’s one of them
<name="ygritte"> No
<name="tormund"> Do you hear me?
<name="tormund"> You’re not gonna die for one of them
<name="jojen"> Do it They’ll find us if you don’t
<name="jon"> You were right the whole time -
<name="daario"> When you hear a songbird’s whistle, you come I’m a great whistler, the greatest in the land
<name="daario"> Daario Naharis
<name="daario"> That one was quick
<name="jorah"> There may be others
<name="daario"> I doubt it The Yunkish prefer to let their slaves do their fighting for them
<name="jorah"> That’s what you call a few guards? -
<name="roslin"> Lord Edmure, I hope I’m not a disappointment to you
<name="edmure"> You’re a delight to me, my lady
<name="septon"> You may now cloak the bride and bring her under your protection
<name="septon"> In the sight of the Seven, I hereby seal these two souls, binding them as one for eternity Look upon each other and say the words.EDMURE
<name="roslin"> Father, Smith, Warrior, Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger I am hers and she is mine from this day until the end of my days -
<name="meera"> Is that safe?
<name="osha"> They’re long gone
<name="bran"> You were right I can get inside Summer’s mind whenever I want
<name="jojen"> Of course you can North of the Wall there are wildlings who can control all sorts of animals But you did a lot more than that You got inside Hodor’s mind
<name="bran"> They can’t do that north of the Wall?
<name="jojen"> No one can do that Anywhere
<name="bran"> When I was looking through Summer’s eyes, I saw Jon
<name="rickon"> Where?
<name="bran"> He was with the wildlings They tried to kill him but he got away
<name="osha"> He’ll be heading back to Castle Black then That’s where we should go
<name="bran"> For all we know, Castle Black’s already under attack If this many wildlings got through
<name="osha"> I already told you I’m not going north of the Wall
<name="bran"> Everything Jojen told me is true You saw what I did to Hodor I have to find the three-eyed raven
<name="osha"> Listen to me, little lord
<name="bran"> Don’t worry, I’m not asking you to come with me It won’t be safe for Rickon
<name="rickon"> Me? I’m coming with you
<name="bran"> No You and Osha and Shaggydog head for the Last Hearth The Umbers are our bannermen They’ll protect you
<name="rickon"> I’m coming with you I’m your brother I have to protect you
<name="bran"> Right now, I have to protect you
<name="bran"> Robb’s at war and I’m going beyond the Wall If something happens to us, you’re the heir to Winterfell
<name="bran"> Will you know how to find the last Hearth?
<name="osha"> You Southerners build your big castles and you never move You’re easy to find
<name="rickon"> We’re not Southerners
<name="rickon"> And I don’t want to leave you
<name="osha"> Shhh Come here, little soldier You and me, we’re gonna have some adventures
<name="bran"> You don’t have to do any of this
<name="osha"> Your family took me in and was good to me when they had no cause to be Shhh We’ll be fine, you and me The Umbers are great warriors Even I heard about them growing up They’ll teach you how to swing a sword
<name="rickon"> I know how to swing a sword
<name="bran"> You’re leaving now? It’s the middle of the night
<name="osha"> I learned to walk in darkness
<name="osha"> Say your good-byes, little man
<name="osha"> Keep this one safe He means the world to me -
<name="daenerys"> We’ve been waiting a long time Haven’t we? Well I don’t know, you tell me How long does it take to sack a city?
<name="jorah"> It was just as you said They did not believe until it was too late Their slave soldiers threw down their spears and surrendered
<name="daenerys"> And Daario Naharis?
<name="daario"> The city is yours, my queen -
<name="talisa"> They’re good, aren’t they?
<name="lothar"> They ought to be because they cost enough
<name="blackfish"> Look at the crowd there
<name="catelyn"> He complained about this marriage the entire ride from Riverrun and now look at him
<name="blackfish"> The God’s love to reward a fool
<name="catelyn"> Uncle
<name="blackfish"> What? He’s my nephew, I love him And he’s a damned fool
<name="catelyn"> Don’t you drink, Lord Bolton?
<name="roose"> Never do, my lady Dulls the senses
<name="blackfish"> That’s the point Didn’t you marry one of these Frey girls?
<name="roose"> Aye Lord Walder let me choose any of his granddaughters and promised me the girl’s weight in silver as a dowry So I have a fat, young bride
<name="catelyn"> I hope she makes you very happy
<name="roose"> Well, she’s made me very rich
<name="blackfish"> Pardon, my lord, my lady I need to find a tree to piss on
<name="robb"> My mother’s alone with Roose Bolton I should rescue her
<name="talisa"> Your mother is less in need of rescue than any woman I’ve ever met
<name="robb"> Be kind She’s finally starting to like you
<name="talisa"> And I like her But if she had her way, I would be back in Volantis, playing my harp and you would be sitting over there , eating blackberries out of Roslin Frey’s hand
<name="robb"> Perhaps I’ve made a terrible mistake
<name="robb"> Striking your king is an act of treason
<name="talisa"> No, don’t Don’t insult them
<name="walder"> Your Grace
<name="walder"> The Septon has prayed his prayers, some words were said and Lord Edmure has wrapped my daughter in a cloak But they are not yet man and wife A sword needs a sheath And a wedding needs a bedding What does my sire say?
<name="everybody"> To bed! To bed! To bed
<name="robb"> If you think the time is right, Lord Walder, by all means, let us bed them
<name="everybody"> To bed! To bed! To bed
<name="edmure"> Ho-ho! Careful now, ladies Once you set that monster free, there’s no caging him again
<name="everybody"> To bed! To bed! To bed
<name="catelyn"> Poor girl
<name="roose"> Every bride suffers the same I’m sure you endured yours with grace
<name="catelyn"> Oh, Ned forbade it He said it wouldn’t be right if he broke a man’s jaw on our wedding night
<name="talisa"> That is a very strange custom
<name="robb"> I suppose it does seem strange from a foreigner’s perspective
<name="talisa"> It seems normal to you?
<name="robb"> It’s tradition Without the bedding ceremony, there’s no real proof the lord and lady consummated their marriage
<name="talisa"> No, but there are other ways of providing proof
<name="robb"> Boy or girl?
<name="talisa"> I don’t know But if it’s a boy, I know what we should name him
<name="robb"> Oh, do you? It seems to me the father should have some say in his son’s naming
<name="talisa"> Eddard Don’t you want to teach little Ned Stark how to ride horses?
<name="robb"> I do
<name="sandor"> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
<name="frey guard"> Where are you going?
<name="sandor"> Got salt pork for the feast
<name="frey guard"> The feast is over
<name="sandor"> It doesn’t sound like it’s over
<name="frey guard"> If I tell you it’s over, it’s over Turn this cart around and get the hell out of here
<name="sandor"> Got pig’s feet, too
<name="frey guard"> Are you soft in the head? Turn this cart around
<name="walder"> Your Grace
<name="walder"> I feel I’ve been remiss in my duties
<name="walder"> I’ve given you meat and wine and music but I haven’t shown you the hospitality you deserve My king has married and I owe my new queen a wedding gift
<name="catelyn"> Robb
<name="man"> You ready to head home to Winterfell, eh?
<name="man"> Feast over yet, is it?
<name="frey man"> Aye, it’s over
<name="sandor"> It’s too late
<name="walder"> ing in the North arises, heh heh
<name="catelyn"> Lord Walder! Lord Walder, enough! Let it end! Please! He is my son! My first son! Let him go and I swear that we will forget this! I swear it by the Old Gods and New! We will take no vengeance
<name="walder"> You already swore me one oath right here in my castle You swore by all the Gods, your son would marry my daughter
<name="catelyn"> Take me for a hostage but let Robb go! Robb, get up! Get up and walk out! Please! Please
<name="walder"> And why I would let him do that?
<name="catelyn"> On my honor as a Tully, on my honor as a Stark, let him go or I will cut your wife’s throat
<name="walder"> I’ll find another
<name="robb"> Mother

<name="boy"> Oh
<name="ygritte"> And Ill be free to kill you Got no respect, this lot Got no fathers to slap em when theyre foul

<name="tormund"> What do we want with a baby crow?
<name="ygritte"> This baby killed Qhorin Halfhand He wants to be one of us
<name="tormund"> That half-handed cunt killed friends of mine Friends twice your size
<name="jon"> My father told me big men fall just as quick as little ones if you put a sword through their hearts
<name="tormund"> Plenty of little men tried to put their swords through my heart And theres plenty of little skeletons buried in the woods Whats your name, boy?
<name="jon"> Jon Snow
<name="jon"> Your Grace
<name="tormund"> Your Grace? Did you hear that? From now on, youd better kneel every time I fart

<name="mance"> This chicken eater you thought was king is Tormund Giantsbane
<name="tormund"> Cant believe this pup killed the Halfhand
<name="mance"> He was our enemy and Im glad hes dead
<name="mance"> He was my brother once Back when he had a whole hand What were you doing with him?
<name="jon"> The Lord Commander sent me to the Halfhand for seasoning
<name="mance"> Why?
<name="jon"> He wants me to lead one day
<name="mance"> But here you are, a traitor kneeling before the King-beyond-the-Wall
<name="jon"> If Im a traitor, then you are, too
<name="mance"> Why do you want to join us, Jon Snow?
<name="jon"> I want to be free
<name="mance"> No, I dont think so I think what you want most of all is to be a hero Ill ask you one last time why do you want to join us?
<name="jon"> We stopped at Crasters Keep on the way north I saw.
<name="mance"> You saw what?
<name="jon"> I saw Craster take his own baby boy and leave it in the woods I saw what took it
<name="mance"> Youre telling me you saw one of them? And why would that make you desert your brothers?
<name="jon"> Because when I told the Lord Commander, he already knew Thousands of years ago, the First Men battled the White Walkers and defeated them I want to fight for the side that fights for the living Did I come to the right place?
<name="mance"> Well need to find you a new cloak
<name="bronn"> What if you took off that bit there?
<name="whore"> Dont you want to leave something to the imagination?
<name="bronn"> Trouble is, Ive never had much imagination
<name="whore"> I want you to take it off
<name="whore"> Mouth
<name="podrick"> Ser Bronn Ser Bronn
<name="bronn"> I didnt hear that
<name="podrick"> Apologies, ser
<name="bronn"> Back away Keep backing away till youre outside this establishment Then back away some more
<name="podrick"> Lord Tyrion sent me
<name="bronn"> I will murder you, boy
<name="podrick"> He said it was a matter of life and death
<name="tyrion"> Pod?
<name="cersei"> Its your sister The queen
<name="tyrion"> What are they doing here?
<name="cersei"> Protecting me, I assume Will you let me in?
<name="tyrion"> No, I dont think so
<name="cersei"> If I wanted to kill you, do you think Id let a wooden door stop me?
<name="tyrion"> They stay outside
<name="cersei"> Im not afraid of you, little brother
<name="tyrion"> Why are you here?
<name="cersei"> I wanted to see your face They said youd lost your nose, but its not as gruesome as all that
<name="tyrion"> The man who cut me lost more than his nose
<name="cersei"> I should hope so The rebels came for Joffreys head, they lost their own Thanks to Father
<name="tyrion"> Thanks to Father Of course, it wasnt a rebel who tried to kill me
<name="cersei"> No? Curious Bit of a comedown from chamber of the Hand But then I dont suppose you need much room
<name="tyrion"> Grand Maester Pycelle made the same joke You must be proud to be as funny as a man whose balls brush his knees
<name="cersei"> Youre meeting Father today?
<name="tyrion"> How do you know that?
<name="cersei"> Because I have hundreds of spies in my employ The Master of Whisperers owes me a favor or two Father told me What do you want from him?
<name="tyrion"> What do I want from him? Hes my father Do I need to want something? Im sure he loves me dearly, as any father loves his child, his baby boy Yet he hasnt come to visit once since arriving in Kings Landing I lay here, my face split in half, but Father never came
<name="cersei"> Youre going to make me cry
<name="tyrion"> Why do you care what I want from him?
<name="cersei"> Because youve slandered me to Father before
<name="tyrion"> Slandered? When?
<name="cersei"> You told him I had my guards beat that servant girl at Casterly Rock
<name="tyrion"> You did have your guards beat her A girl of nine, I believe
<name="cersei"> I was nine, too
<name="tyrion"> She lost an eye, if I remember correctly
<name="cersei"> If I remember correctly, she never stole a necklace again
<name="tyrion"> Its not slander if its true
<name="cersei"> And whats this truth you plan on telling him today?
<name="tyrion"> Why are you so nervous about what Im going to say to Father?
<name="cersei"> Because youre a liar I expect youll tell lies about me, about Joffrey
<name="tyrion"> Any lies in particular?
<name="cersei"> Youre a clever man, but youre not half as clever as you think you are
<name="tyrion"> Still makes me more clever than you
<name="bronn"> Oh, look at these two shining warriors Ser Taryn Mant and Ser Whosit of Whocares
<name="meryn trant"> Ser Meryn Trant
<name="bronn"> Ser Bronn of the Blackwater
<name="meryn trant"> Youre no knight
<name="bronn"> Pod
<name="podrick"> Ser Bronn of the Blackwater was anointed by the king himself
<name="meryn trant"> Youre an up-jumped cutthroat, nothing more
<name="bronn"> Thats exactly who I am And youre a grub in fancy armor whos better at beating little girls than fighting men Now, I have an appointment with Lord Tyrion
<name="meryn trant"> You put your hand on that door, you lose the hand
<name="bronn"> As much as I appreciate a walk in the sunshine, your lordship, I am wondering why you sent for me
<name="tyrion"> A number of people in this city want to kill me Youre here to protect me
<name="bronn"> Ive been doing that for a while now
<name="tyrion"> Do you grow bored protecting me?
<name="bronn"> I grow poor protecting you
<name="tyrion"> Poor? Poor? Under my patronage youve become a knight, youve served as Commander of the City Watch
<name="bronn"> Briefly
<name="tyrion"> Im sure you filled your pockets
<name="bronn"> And now my pockets are empty Youve given me a taste for the finer things And if you want me to carry on protecting you, youll need to pay more
<name="tyrion"> I thought we were friends
<name="bronn"> We are But Im a sellsword I sell my sword I dont loan it out to friends as a favor
<name="tyrion"> How much?
<name="bronn"> Double
<name="tyrion"> Double?
<name="bronn"> Im a knight now Knights are worth double
<name="tyrion"> I dont even know how much Im paying you now
<name="bronn"> Which means you can afford it
<name="blackwater bay davos"> Here Here! Help me
<name="man"> Who are you?
<name="davos"> I was in the battle at Blackwater I was a captain and a knight
<name="man"> Aye, ser, and serving which king?
<name="davos"> The one true king of Westeros Stannis Baratheon
<name="salladhor"> I thought you were dead Everyone thought you were dead And your son?
<name="salladhor"> He may have swam ashore as you did
<name="davos"> No, the wildfire took him I saw it
<name="salladhor"> Im so sorry, my friend I, too, have lost a son There is nothing worse in this world But, Davos, you were a good father
<name="davos"> If I was a good father, hed still be here Stannis lives?
<name="salladhor"> He licks his wounds at Dragonstone
<name="davos"> Will you take me there?
<name="salladhor"> There is nothing for me at Dragonstone
<name="davos"> This war is not over
<name="salladhor"> Not for you, maybe But for Salladhor Saan, the war is over
<name="davos"> Were both sworn to King Stannis
<name="salladhor"> I am sworn to no man I promised you 30 ships and you promised me riches and glory I delivered the ships
<name="davos"> Stannis never gives up Never Now he will regroup .
<name="salladhor"> Hes a broken man His fleet lies at the bottom of Blackwater Bay They say he sees no one not his generals, not even his wife Only the Red Woman whispering in his ear, telling him what she sees in the flames and burning men alive
<name="davos"> What?
<name="salladhor"> They built a great fire when Stannis returned All those who spoke against her she called servants of darkness They say she sang to them as they burned
<name="salladhor"> Im a pirate
<name="davos"> Youre a smuggler
<name="salladhor"> Servants of darkness Im thinking Dragonstone is a good place for us to avoid
<name="davos"> Take me back there, please
<name="salladhor"> You cannot turn Stannis against her
<name="davos"> Maybe not, but I could carve her heart out
<name="salladhor"> You could try If you fail, they will burn you If you succeed, theyll burn you And youve only just come back to life Stay alive a little longer, my friend
<name="davos"> You call me friend You drank with me on my wedding day
<name="salladhor"> And you drank with me on four of my wedding days, but I dont ask you for favors
<name="davos"> I have to stop her Please, do this for me
<name="salladhor"> When you are dead, I will gather your bones in a little sack and let your widow wear them around her neck
<name="roose bolton"> We should set the siege lines 1,000 yards from Harrenhal
<name="robb"> There wont be a siege The Mountain cant defend a ruin
<name="roose bolton"> I imagine the Mountain will defend whatever Tywin Lannister tells him to defend
<name="robb"> The Lannisters have been running from us since Oxcross Id love a fight The men would love a fight I dont think were going to get one
<name="rickard kar"> 200 Northmen slaughtered like sheep
<name="roose bolton"> The debt will be repaid, my friend For them and for your sons
<name="rickard kar"> Will it? They rot in the ground while their killer runs free
<name="roose bolton"> ingslayer wont remain free for long My best hunters are after him
<name="robb"> A Mallister?
<name="catelyn"> Ser Jeremy My fathers bannerman
<name="robb"> Find her a chamber that will serve as a cell
<name="talisa"> Shes your mother
<name="robb"> She freed Jaime Lannister The Lannisters robbed them of their sons and she robbed them of their justice
<name="qyburn"> Water Water
<name="talisa"> This needs to be cleaned and closed
<name="robb"> Whats your name, friend?
<name="qyburn"> Qyburn
<name="talisa"> Youre lucky to be alive
<name="qyburn"> Lucky?
<name="tyrion"> The badge looks good on you Almost as good as it looked on me Are you enjoying your new position?
<name="tywin"> Am I enjoying it?
<name="tyrion"> I was very happy as Hand of the King
<name="tywin"> Yes I heard how happy you were You brought a whore into my bed
<name="tyrion"> It wasnt your bed at the time
<name="tywin"> I sent you here to advise the king I gave you real power and authority You chose to spend your days as you always have, bedding harlots and drinking with thieves
<name="tyrion"> Occasionally I drank with the harlots
<name="tywin"> What do you want, Tyrion?
<name="tyrion"> Why does everyone assume I want something? Cant I simply visit with my beloved father? My beloved father who somehow forgot to visit his wounded son after he fell on the battlefield
<name="tywin"> Maester Pycelle assured me your wounds were not fatal
<name="tyrion"> I organized the defense of this city while you held court in the ruins of Harrenhal I led the foray when the enemies were at the gate while your grandson, the king, quivered in fear behind the walls I bled in the mud for our family And as my reward, I was trundled off to some dark little cell But what do I want? A little bloody gratitude would be a start
<name="tywin"> Jugglers and singers require applause You are a Lannister Do you think I demanded a garland of roses every time I suffered a wound on a battlefield? Hmm? Now, I have seven kingdoms to look after and three of them are in open rebellion So tell me what you want
<name="tyrion"> I want what is mine by right Jaime is your eldest son, heir to your lands and titles But he is a Kingsguard, forbidden from marriage or inheritance The day Jaime put on the white cloak, he gave up his claim to Casterly Rock I am your son and lawful heir
<name="tywin"> You want Casterly Rock?
<name="tyrion"> It is mine by right
<name="tywin"> Well find you accommodations more suited to your name and as a reward for your accomplishments during the battle of Blackwater Bay And when the time is right, you will be given a position fit for your talents so that you can serve your family and protect our legacy And if you serve faithfully, you will be rewarded with a suitable wife And I would let myself be consumed by maggots before mocking the family name and making you heir to Casterly Rock
<name="tyrion"> Why?
<name="tywin"> Why? You ask that? You, who killed your mother to come into the world? You are an ill-made, spiteful little creature full of envy, lust, and low cunning Mens laws give you the right to bear my name and display my colors since I cannot prove that you are not mine And to teach me humility, the gods have condemned me to watch you waddle about wearing that proud lion that was my fathers sigil and his fathers before him But neither gods nor men will ever compel me to let you turn Casterly Rock into your whorehouse Go, now Speak no more of your rights to Casterly Rock Go
<name="tywin"> Oh, one more thing The next whore I catch in your bed Ill hang
<name="sansa"> Dorne Its going to Dorne
<name="shae"> Why Dorne?
<name="sansa"> Its carrying silk and its supposed to bring back wine in exchange But its not coming back The captains tired of risking his life so Kings Landing lords and ladies can get drunk on better wine than they deserve Hes going to stay in Dorne Wait out the winter where its beautiful and warm
<name="shae"> I met some people in Dorne who werent so beautiful and warm
<name="sansa"> Dont ruin the game
<name="shae"> I told you, I dont want to play
<name="sansa"> What about that one there?
<name="shae"> That one? Its going to Volantis
<name="sansa"> Why?
<name="shae"> Because when I got on a ship in Volantis, it looked like that one
<name="sansa"> Thats not how the game works Youre not supposed to just blurt out the right answer Youve got to invent a story about where the ship is going and why
<name="shae"> Why should I make up a story when I know the truth?
<name="sansa"> Because the truth is always either terrible or boring
<name="littlefinger"> Lovely day for it Watching the ships
<name="sansa"> Lord Baelish
<name="littlefinger"> Might I speak with Lady Sansa alone for a moment?
<name="littlefinger"> I saw your mother not long ago Shes very eager to see you And your sister
<name="sansa"> Aryas alive? You said youd take me home
<name="littlefinger"> You said Kings Landing was your home You are the property of the crown Stealing you would be treason If you were to tell just one person .
<name="sansa"> I wont tell anyone
<name="littlefinger"> How do I know?
<name="sansa"> Because Im a terrible liar You said so yourself Please, Lord Baelish Tell me what to do Tell me when
<name="littlefinger"> Im waiting for word on an assignment that will take me far away from the capital When I set sail, I might be able to take you with me But youll need to be ready to leave on a moments notice
<name="ros"> Youre her handmaiden?
<name="shae"> Yes And youre his ?
<name="ros"> I help manage his affairs
<name="shae"> Hes an important person
<name="ros"> So is she I grew up in the shadow of her fathers castle The day she was born, they rang the bells from sunrise till sunset Weve both done rather well, you and I
<name="shae"> Yes
<name="ros"> Given where we started
<name="shae"> And where is that?
<name="ros"> Its not easy for girls like us to dig our way out Watch out for her
<name="shae"> I always do
<name="ros"> Watch out for her with him
<name="jorah"> Theyre growing fast
<name="daenerys"> Not fast enough I cant wait that long I need an army
<name="jorah"> Well be in Astapor by nightfall Some say the Unsullied are the greatest soldiers in the world
<name="daenerys"> The greatest slave-soldiers in the world The distinction means a good deal to some people
<name="jorah"> Do those people have any better ideas about how to put you on the Iron Throne?
<name="daenerys"> Its too beautiful a day to argue
<name="jorah"> Youre right Another lovely day on the high seas
<name="daenerys"> Dont mock them Theyre the first Dothraki who have ever been on a ship They followed me across the poison water If theyll do it, others will And with a true khalasar .
<name="jorah"> The Dothraki follow strength above all, khaleesi Youll have a true khalasar when you prove yourself strong And not before
<name="davos"> Your Grace
<name="stannis"> I heard you were dead
<name="davos"> Not yet
<name="stannis"> I had hoped to speak to you alone, Your Grace
<name="stannis"> We are alone
<name="davos"> Your Grace, you are the rightful king Not only by blood Youre an honorable man, a just man And there is still a war to fight
<name="stannis"> I am fighting
<name="davos"> By burning prisoners alive?
<name="melisandre"> How would you punish the infidels, Ser Davos?
<name="davos"> I do not judge people for the gods they worship If I did, Id have thrown you in the sea before you ever set foot on Dragonstone
<name="melisandre"> Im not your enemy
<name="davos"> You are my enemy
<name="melisandre"> Was it me you fought on Blackwater Bay? Did I set your ships ablaze? I wasnt there when the wildfire killed our men by the thousands I could have saved those men You would have taken the city, Stannis would now sit upon his rightful throne, and you would stand beside him But I wasnt there because you convinced your king to leave me behind Do you hear them screaming? All those burning men in the water crying for their mothers, for their gods for help? Until the moment the Blackwater swallowed them
<name="melisandre"> Dont despair, Ser Davos What I told your son is true
<name="melisandre"> Death by fire is the purest death
<name="davos"> This woman is evil! Shes the mother of demons
<name="stannis"> Take him to the dungeon and lock him in a cell
<name="davos"> Your Grace
<name="guard"> Come on
<name="melisandre"> Youve chosen the darkness, Ser Davos
<name="davos"> She will destroy us all
<name="melisandre"> I will pray for you
<name="davos"> Your Grace
<name="guard"> Halt Down
<name="guard"> Halt Down
<name="joffrey"> Why have we stopped?
<name="guard"> Its Lady Margaery, Your Grace
<name="joffrey"> What is she doing? Who gave her permission?
<name="maid"> My lady We should have guards, my lady
<name="margaery"> Why?
<name="margaery"> Pardon me
<name="maid"> Stop, my lady Youll ruin your dress
<name="margaery"> I have others
<name="guard"> Would you like to speak with her, Your Grace?
<name="joffrey"> No
<name="child"> He was a soldier He went to fight on the walls when the ships came into Blackwater Bay He never came back
<name="margaery"> And your mother?
<name="child"> She died when she had me
<name="margaery"> Bad men wanted to come into this city and do terrible things, but your father stopped them
<name="margaery"> Whenever you look at this knight, I want you to remember your father
<name="child"> He wasnt a knight He was just a soldier
<name="margaery"> And what do knights swear to do? Protect the weak and uphold the good Your father did that Be proud of him
<name="margaery"> Was your father a soldier, too?
<name="margaery"> You should be proud, too Under King Joffreys leadership, your fathers saved the city They saved us all From now on, were going to take care of you All of you
<name="margaery"> Come to me for whatever you need to feed them, clothe them, or house them Directly to me
<name="margaery"> Your Grace
<name="loras"> Your Grace
<name="joffrey"> Please, sit Sit I do apologize, my lady Small council meetings At what point does it become treason to waste the kings time?
<name="joffrey"> Thats a lovely gown, my lady
<name="cersei"> Yes, it suits you perfectly I imagine you might be rather cold
<name="margaery"> The climate is a bit more forgiving back in Highgarden, Your Grace
<name="joffrey"> Shall I have them bring you a shawl, my lady?
<name="margaery"> I am touched by your concern, Your Grace Luckily for us Tyrells, our blood runs quite warm Doesnt it, Loras?
<name="loras"> Yes
<name="margaery"> Loras, isnt the queens gown magnificent? The fabric, the embroidery, the metalwork Ive never seen anything like it
<name="cersei"> You might find a bit of armor quite useful once you become queen Perhaps before Joffrey tells me you stopped your carriage at Flea Bottom on your way back from the sept this morning
<name="margaery"> Yes I paid a visit to an orphanage the High Septon told me about
<name="loras"> Margaery does a great deal of work with the poor back in Highgarden
<name="margaery"> The lowest among us are no different from the highest if you give them a chance and approach them with an open heart
<name="cersei"> An open heart is what youll get in Flea Bottom if youre not careful, my dear Not long ago, we were attacked by a mob there We had a full complement of guards that didnt stop them The king barely escaped with his life
<name="joffrey"> My mothers always had a penchant for drama Facts become less and less important to her as she grows older Our lives were never truly in danger
<name="cersei"> Youre right, of course But you are your fathers son We cant all have a kings bravery
<name="margaery"> Hunger turns men into beasts Im glad House Tyrell has been able to help in this regard They tell me 100 wagons arrive daily now from the Reach Wheat, barley, apples Weve had a blessed harvest And, of course, its our duty to assist the capital in time of need
<name="joffrey"> Well, as Ser Loras said, Lady Margaery has done this sort of charitable work before Im sure she knows what shes doing
<name="cersei"> Im sure she does
<name="cut to"> The path leading to Astapor KRAZNYS MO
<name="missandei"> The Unsullied have stood here for a day and a night with no food or water
<name="missandei"> They will stand until they drop
<name="missandei"> Such is their obedience
<name="daenerys"> They may suit my needs Tell me of their training
<name="missandei"> The Westrosi woman is pleased with them, but speaks no praise to keep the price down She wished to know how they are trained
<name="kraznys mo nakloz"> Tell her what she would know and be quick about it
<name="missandei"> They begin their training at five Every day they drill from dawn to dusk until they have mastered the shortsword, the shield, and the three spears Only one boy in four survives this rigorous training
<name="missandei"> Their discipline and loyalty are absolute They fear nothing
<name="jorah"> Even the bravest men fear death
<name="missandei"> The knight says even brave men fear death
<name="kraznys mo nakloz"> Tell the old man he smells of piss
<name="missandei"> Truly, master?
<name="kraznys mo nakloz"> No, not truly Are you a girl or a goat to ask such a thing?
<name="missandei"> My master says the Unsullied are not men Death means nothing to them
<name="kraznys mo nakloz"> Tell this ignorant whore of a Westerner to open her eyes and watch
<name="missandei"> He begs you attend to this carefully, Your Grace
<name="daenerys"> Tell the good master there is no need
<name="kraznys mo nakloz"> Shes worried about their nipples? Doers the dumb bitch know weve cut off their balls?
<name="missandei"> My master points out that men dont need nipples
<name="kraznys mo nakloz"> Here, Im done with you
<name="unsullied"> This one is pleased to have served you
<name="missandei"> To win his shield, an Unsullied must go to the slave marts with a silver mark, find a newborn and kill it before its mothers eyes This way, my master says, we make certain there is no weakness left in them
<name="daenerys"> You take a babe from its mothers arms, kill it as she watches, and pay for her pain with a silver coin?
<name="missandei"> She is offended She asks if you pay a sliver coin to the mother for her dead baby
<name="kraznys mo nakloz"> What a soft mewling fool this one is
<name="missandei"> My master would like you to know that the silver is paid to the babys owner, not the mother
<name="daenerys"> How many do you have to sell?
<name="missandei"> 8000 KRAZNYS MO
<name="nakloz"> Tell the Westerosi whore she has until tomorrow
<name="missandei"> Master Kraznys asks that you please hurry Many other buyers are interested
<name="daenerys"> 8,000 dead babies
<name="jorah"> The Unsullied are a means to an end
<name="daenerys"> Once I own them, these men .
<name="jorah"> Theyre not men Not anymore
<name="daenerys"> Once I own an army of slaves, what will I be?
<name="jorah"> Do you think these slaves will have better lives serving Kraznys and men like him or serving you?
<name="jorah"> Youll be fair to them You wont mutilate them to make a point
<name="jorah"> You wont order them to murder babies Youll see theyre properly fed and sheltered A great injustice has been done to them Closing your eyes will not undo it
<name="daenerys"> The warlocks
<name="daenerys"> I owe you my life, ser
<name="barristan selmy"> The honor is mine, my queen
<name="daenerys"> You know this man?
<name="jorah"> I know him as one of the greatest fighters the Seven Kingdoms has ever seen and as the Lord Commander of Robert Baratheons Kingsguard




Season 3
EPISODE "WALK OF PUNISHMENT" - 14/04/2013


<name="edmure"> If I may, nephew, I encountered a situation with one of my lieutenants at the Stone Mill which may have some bearing-
<name="brynden"> Why dont you shut your mouth about that damned mill? And dont call him nephew He is your king
<name="edmure"> Robb knows I meant him no disr-
<name="brynden"> Youre lucky Im not your king I wouldnt let you wave your blunders around like a victory flag
<name="edmure"> My blunder sent Tywins mad scurrying back to Casterly Rock with his tail between his legs I think King Robb understands were not gonna win this war if hes the only one winning any battles No, theres glory enough to go around
<name="robb"> Its not about glory Your instructions were to wait for him to come to you
<name="edmure"> I seized an opportunity
<name="robb"> What value was the mill?
<name="edmure"> The Mountain was garrisoned across the river from it
<name="robb"> Is he there now? Of course not
<name="edmure"> We took the fight to him He could not withstand us
<name="robb"> I wanted to draw the Mountain into the west, into our country where we could surround him and kill him I wanted him to chase us, which he would have done because he is a mad without a strategic thought in his head I could have that head on a spike by now Instead, I have a mill
<name="edmure"> We took hostages Willem Lannister Martyn Lannister
<name="robb"> Willem and Martyn Lannister are 14 years old
<name="brynden"> Martyn is 15, I believe
<name="robb"> Tywin Lannister has my sisters Have I sued for peace?
<name="edmure"> No
<name="robb"> Do you think hell sue for peace because we have his fathers brothers great-grandsons?
<name="edmure"> No
<name="robb"> How many men did you lose?
<name="edmure"> But for every man we lost, the Lannisters-
<name="robb"> We need our men more than Tywin needs his
<name="edmure"> Im sorry I didnt know
<name="robb"> You would have Right here today at this gathering if you had been patient
<name="brynden"> We seem to be running short of patience here
<name="robb"> You know who isnt? Tywin Lannister TYWIN stands by the head of the table PYCELLE, VARYS, and LITTLEFINGER enter silently enters next TYWIN sits, then PYCELLE, VARYS, and LITTLEFINGER join him remains still, while CERSEI enters and surveys the room She pauses, then walks to the table She picks up one of the two remaining empty chairs and places it directly next to TYWIN, then sits while the others smirk comes forward, and drags the final chair noisily to the opposite head of the table
<name="tyrion"> Intimate Lovely table Better chairs than the old small council chamber Conveniently close to your own quarters I like it
<name="tywin"> What news of Jaime?
<name="tywin"> 20,000 unwashed northerns have known about his escape for weeks Collectively, you control more spies and informants than the rest of the world combined Do you mean to tell me that none of you has any notion of where he is?
<name="varys"> We are trying, my lord
<name="tywin"> Try harder What do we have, then?
<name="varys"> Robb Stark and most of his bannermen are in Riverrun for the funeral of his grandfather Lord Hoster Tully In Starks absence, Roose Bolton holds Harrenhal, which would seem to make him Lord of Harrenhal, in practice if not in name
<name="tywin"> Well, let him have it The name suits our purposes far more than that useless pile of rubble The Lord of Harrenhal will make a worthy suitor for the widow Arryn
<name="littlefinger"> For which I am extremely grateful to you, my lord Lady Arryn and I have known each other since we were children She has always been positively predisposed toward me
<name="pycelle"> A successful courtship would make Lord Baelish acting Lord of the Vale
<name="littlefinger"> Titles do seem to breed titles
<name="tywin"> Youll leave for the Eyrie as soon as possible and bring Lysa Arryn into the fold Then the young wolf can add his own aunt to the list of people who have taken up arms against him
<name="tyrion"> Far be it from me to hinder true love, but Lord Baelishs absence would present certain problems The royal wedding may end up being the most expensive event in living memory Summer has ended, hard days lie ahead Not a good time to leave the crowns finances unattended
<name="tywin"> Fully agreed Which is why Im naming you new Master of Coin
<name="tyrion"> Master of Coin?
<name="tywin"> It would appear to be a position that best suits your talents
<name="tyrion"> Im quite good at spending money, but a lifetime of outrageous wealth hasnt taught me much about managing it
<name="cersei"> I have no doubt you will prove equal to this challenge
<name="pycelle"> Hear, hear
<name="men"> He lifted her high in the air He sniffed and roared and smelled her there She kicked and wailed, a maid so fair But he licked the honey from her hair From there to here, from here to there All black and brown and covered with hair He smelled that girl in the summer air The bear, the bear and the maiden fair
<name="jaime"> I hope youre pleased If you had armed me, they never would have taken us
<name="brienne"> You were armed when we were taken
<name="jaime"> I was in chains if you recall Our little match would have ended quite quick if my hands werent bound
<name="brienne"> All my life Ive been hearing, Jaime Lannister, what a brilliant swordsman You were slower than I expected And more predictable
<name="jaime"> Ive been sitting in a muddy pen wrapped in chains for the past year
<name="brienne"> And Im a woman I was still beating you
<name="jaime"> You were not beating me
<name="brienne"> Maybe you were as good as people said once Or maybe people just love to overpraise a famous name
<name="jaime"> When we make camp tonight, youll be raped More than once None of these fellows have ever been with a noblewoman Youd be wise not to resist
<name="brienne"> Would I?
<name="jaime"> Theyll knock your teeth out
<name="brienne"> You think I care about my teeth?
<name="jaime"> No, I dont think you care about your teeth If you fight them, they will kill you Do you understand? Im the prisoner of value, not you Let them have what they want What does it matter?
<name="brienne"> What does it matter?
<name="jaime"> Close your eyes Pretend theyre Renly
<name="brienne"> If you were a woman, you wouldnt resist? Youd let them do what they wanted?
<name="jaime"> If I was a woman, Id make them kill me But Im not, thank the gods
<name="gendry"> If I had a proper forge, I could make it good as new
<name="thoros"> Doesnt have to look pretty It just has to keep the arrows out of my heart
<name="arya"> Why are you helping him? He takes us prisoner and now hes our friend?
<name="thoros"> Youre not our prisoner, little lady
<name="arya"> What am I?
<name="thoros"> Our guest No ones put any chains on you
<name="arya"> So I can walk away, then?
<name="thoros"> These woods arent safe for Ned Starks daughter oure lucky we found you
<name="sandor"> You think youre good with that bow, you little twat?
<name="anguy"> Better than anyone youve ever met
<name="sandor"> A cowards weapon I like to fight up close I like to see a mans face when I put the steel in him
<name="anguy"> Why? So you can kiss him?
<name="arya"> You remember the last time you were here?
<name="sandor"> Looks like every other shit inn on the road
<name="anguy"> Now, apologies, but youre one ugly fucker and Id rather not see you no more
<name="anguy"> Watch your head Off we go
<name="driver"> Walk up
<name="arya"> What are you doing? Were about to leave
<name="hot pie"> Im staying
<name="gendry"> Youre what?
<name="hot pie"> I baked some brown bread for the innkeep and she said she never had better Told Thoros shes keeping me as a payment for all the free meals shes given him Anyway, its not me the Brotherhood wants My brother aint no king Im not a Stark of Winterhell
<name="arya"> Winterfell
<name="hot pie"> You sure?
<name="arya"> Im sure
<name="hot pie"> Well, I made you something
<name="arya"> What is it?
<name="hot pie"> Its a wolf
<name="gendry"> Yes, it is
<name="arya"> Thats the tail?
<name="hot pie"> Yeah
<name="gendry"> Well, be safe
<name="hot pie"> Yeah, you, too Dont get stabbed
<name="gendry"> You dont burn your fingers
<name="arya"> Good-bye, Hot Pie
<name="hot pie"> Good-bye, Arry
<name="man"> Up you go, little lady
<name="arya"> Hey, Hot Pie Its really good
<name="catelyn"> A person could almost be forgiven for forgetting were at war
<name="brynden"> It often comforts me to think that even in wars darkest days, in most places in the world absolutely nothing is happening
<name="catelyn"> Ive missed you, Uncle Father missed you, too, from the day you left Maybe he never said it in so many words-
<name="brynden"> Maybe? Your father was a stubborn old ox I was surprised when he died Didnt think death had the patience
<name="catelyn"> Im glad you were with him I wish to the gods I had been Did you make peace in the end?
<name="brynden"> After 30 years of fighting, I dont think he remembered what started it He asked me to stop calling myself Blackfish He said it was an old joke and it was never funny to begin with I told him people had been calling me Blackfish for so long, they dont remember my real name
<name="catelyn"> Every time he would leave for the capital or fight in a campaign, Id see him off Wait for me, little Cat, hed say Wait for me and Ill come back to you And I would sit at this window every day when the sun came up, waiting I wonder how many times did Bran or Rickon stare across the moors of Winterfell waiting for me to return I will never see them again
<name="brynden"> You mustnt think it We dont know the truth They could be in hiding Robb believes theyre alive And he must go on believing Hes got to remain strong if hes to prevail And you must remain strong for him
<name="martyn"> Youre Robb Starks wife
<name="talisa"> Hold still
<name="martyn"> Is it true what they say about him?
<name="talisa"> I dont know What do they say about him?
<name="martyn"> That he can turn into a wolf at night
<name="talisa"> True
<name="martyn"> And he eats the flesh of his enemies
<name="talisa"> True Youre a Lannister, arent you?
<name="martyn"> Martyn Lannister

<name="melisandre"> I will never abandon you You are the Son of Fire I am sworn to serve you
<name="stannis"> Then serve me
<name="melisandre"> When I return, you will understand
<name="stannis"> My enemies think theyve destroyed me Theyre laughing at me the way Renly laughed at me I want Joffrey dead I want Robb Stark dead Make me another son
<name="melisandre"> I cannot
<name="stannis"> Why?
<name="melisandre"> You dont have the strength It would kill you
<name="stannis"> Im not so easily killed Men have been trying for years
<name="stannis"> I want you
<name="melisandre"> Your fires burn low, my king
<name="melisandre"> There is another way A better way
<name="stannis"> You told me your magic requires a kings blood
<name="melisandre"> Yes
<name="stannis"> Im the one true king
<name="melisandre"> You are But there are others with your blood in their veins You will sit on the Iron Throne, but first there must be sacrifices The Lord of Light demands it
<name="barristan"> The Walk of Punishment is a warning, Your Grace
<name="daenerys"> To whom?
<name="barristan"> To any slave who contemplates doing whatever these slaves did
<name="daenerys"> Give me your water
<name="jorah"> Khaleesi, this man has been sentenced to death
<name="daenerys"> Here, drink
<name="barristan"> Leave this place, Your Grace Leave tonight, I beg you
<name="jorah"> And what is she to do for soldiers?
<name="barristan"> We can find sellswords in Pentos and Myr
<name="jorah"> Is it we already, Ser Barristan? If you want to sit on the throne your ancestors built, you must win it That will mean blood on your hands before the thing is done
<name="daenerys"> The blood of my enemies, not the blood of innocents
<name="jorah"> How many wars have you fought in, Ser Barristan?
<name="barristan"> Three
<name="jorah"> Have you ever seen a war where innocents didnt die by the thousands?
<name="jorah"> I was in Kings Landing after the sack, khaleesi You know what I saw? Butchery Babies, children, old men More women raped than you can count Theres a beast in every man and it stirs when you put a sword in his hand But the Unsullied are not men They do not rape They do not put cities to the sword unless theyre ordered to do so If you buy them, the only men theyll kill are those you want dead
<name="daenerys"> Do you disagree, Ser Barristan?
<name="barristan"> When your brother Rhaegar led his army into battle at the Trident, men died for him because they believed in him, because they loved him, not because theyd been bought at a slavers auction I fought beside the last dragon on that day, Your Grace I bled beside him
<name="jorah"> Rhaegar fought valiantly, Rhaegar fought nobly, and Rhaegar died
<name="daenerys"> Did you know him well, Ser Barristan?
<name="barristan"> I did, Your Grace Finest man I ever met
<name="daenerys"> I wish I had known him But he was not the last dragon
<name="missandei"> All? Did this ones ears mishear, Your Grace?
<name="daenerys"> They did not I want to buy them all
<name="missandei"> She wants to buy them all
<name="kraznys"> She cant afford them The slut thinks that she can flash her tits, and make us give her whatever she wants
<name="missandei"> There are 8,000 Unsullied in Astapor Is this what you mean by all?
<name="daenerys"> Yes 8,000 And the ones still in training as well
<name="greizhen"> If they fail on the battlefield, they will shape Astapor
<name="missandei"> Master Greizhen says they cannot sell half-trained boys If they fail on the battlefield, they will bring shame upon all of Astapor
<name="daenerys"> I will have them all or take none Many will fall in battle Ill need the boys to pick up the swords they drop
<name="kraznys"> The slut cannot pay for all of this
<name="missandei"> Master Kraznys says you cannot afford this
<name="kraznys"> Her ship will buy her 100 Unsullied, no more
<name="missandei"> Your ship will buy you Because Master Kraznys is generous
<name="kraznys"> And this is because I like the curve of her ass
<name="missandei"> The gold you have left is worth 10
<name="kraznys"> What is left will buy her 10 I will give her 20 if it stops her ignorant whimpering
<name="missandei"> But good Master Kraznys will give you 20
<name="kraznys"> Her Dothraki smell of shit but will be useful as pig feed
<name="missandei"> The Dothraki you have with you-
<name="kraznys"> I will give her 3 for those
<name="missandei"> The Dothraki you have are not worth what they cost to feed, but Master Kraznys will give you three Unsullied for all of them
<name="kraznys"> So, ask this beggar queen how will she pay for the remaining 7,877?
<name="missandei"> Master Kraznys asks how you propose to pay for the remaining 7,877 unsullied
<name="daenerys"> I have dragons Ill give you one
<name="barristan"> You will win the throne with dragons, not slaves, Your Grace
<name="jorah"> Khaleesi, please
<name="kraznys"> Three dragons
<name="daenerys"> One
<name="kraznys"> Two
<name="daenerys"> One
<name="missandei"> They want the biggest one
<name="daenerys"> Done
<name="kraznys"> Done
<name="daenerys"> Ill take you as well, now Youll be Master Kraznys gift to me A token of a bargain well struck
<name="missandei"> She asks that you give me to her, as a present She asks that you do this now
<name="jorah"> Khaleesi, a dragon is worth more than any army
<name="barristan"> Aegon Targaryen proved that
<name="daenerys"> Youre both here to advise me I value your advice, but if you ever question me in front of strangers again, youll be advising someone else Is that understood?
<name="daenerys"> Do you have a name?
<name="missandei"> This ones name is Missandei, Your Grace
<name="daenerys"> Do you have a family? A mother and a father youd return to if you had the choice?
<name="missandei"> No, Your Grace No family living
<name="daenerys"> You belong to me now It is your duty to tell me the truth
<name="missandei"> Yes, Your Grace Lying is a great offense Many of those on the Walk of Punishment were taken there for less
<name="daenerys"> I offered water to one of the slaves dying on the Walk of Punishment Do you know what he said to me? Let me die
<name="missandei"> There are no masters in the grave, Your Grace
<name="daenerys"> Is it true what Master Kraznys told me about the Unsullied? About their obedience?
<name="missandei"> All questions have been taken from them They obey, that is all Once they are yours, they are yours They will fall on their swords if you command it
<name="daenerys"> And what about you? You know that Im taking you to war You may go hungry You may fall sick You may be killed
<name="missandei"> Valar morghulis
<name="daenerys"> Yes, all men must die But we are not men
<name="tyrion"> A surprising place to keep the royal ledgers
<name="littlefinger"> Im surprised youre surprised This is the safest place in the city
<name="tyrion"> Not for bastards
<name="ros"> Thats all of them, my lord
<name="littlefinger"> Thank you, my dear
<name="tyrion"> Pod Pod Take them outside Ill be there in a moment
<name="podrick"> Yes, my lord
<name="littlefinger"> I hear you owe that boy a significant debt
<name="tyrion"> Only my life Not all that significant, Im afraid
<name="littlefinger"> You should have him knighted
<name="tyrion"> If only the Master of Coin had such power
<name="littlefinger"> If only I owe you a significant debt Our redheaded friend You secured her release when the queen detained her
<name="tyrion"> Oh, that Of course A simple misunderstanding
<name="littlefinger"> Apparently, Her Grace believed that you two had some sort of special relationship
<name="tyrion"> We dont I did fuck her once
<name="littlefinger"> I know
<name="tyrion"> But we dont
<name="littlefinger"> I know But how would the queen get that idea?
<name="tyrion"> Why dont you ask her? Any advice for me on my new position?
<name="littlefinger"> Keep a low profile
<name="tyrion"> If I had a gold dragon for every time I heard that joke, Id be richer than you are
<name="littlefinger"> Well, you are richer than I am
<name="tyrion"> Good point
<name="littlefinger"> Theyre only numbers Numbers on paper Once you understand that, its easy to make them behave Trivial even You want a real challenge? Try whores
<name="tyrion"> Ive tried quite a few Well, lots of work to do Enjoy the Eyrie
<name="bronn"> Come on, Im here later Come on
<name="bronn"> Tonight, then Looks like dull reading
<name="tyrion"> You think all reading is dull reading
<name="bronn"> Its an opinion I share with some of the finest men I know
<name="tyrion"> The secret history of the Seven Kingdoms is written in these pages
<name="bronn"> Unless Lord Twatbeard made up a bunch of numbers to hide what hes really up to
<name="tyrion"> Unless he made it all up, yes Podrick, do keep up
<name="podrick"> Yes, my lord
<name="tyrion"> Podrick
<name="podrick"> Yes, my lord?
<name="tyrion"> After a long consultation with my colleague Ser Bronn, I finally found a suitable reward for the services youve provided over and above what might be considered reasonable Tell me, Pod, have you ever been with a woman?
<name="podrick"> No, my lord
<name="tyrion"> Wonderful Genna specializes in first-timers
<name="bronn"> Shes not bad with second-timers, either
<name="podrick"> Uh
<name="tyrion"> A fair enough repayment for putting your spear through my would-be killers face, wouldnt you say?
<name="tyrion"> Now, as it happens, Marei is quite the spear handler herself Shes here to thank you for staying by my side as the battle raged all around me
<name="marei"> Hes handsome You didnt tell me he was handsome
<name="tyrion"> Kayla is famous from here to Volantis in certain circles One of four women in the world who can perform a proper Meereenese Knot
<name="podrick"> My lord
<name="tyrion"> Shes here to thank you for being a thoroughly respectful fellow whos never once failed to address me as my lord
<name="tyrion"> Be back in time for my supper
<name="bronn"> Pace yourself, lad
<name="tyrion"> For years Ive heard that Littlefinger is a magician Whenever the crown needs money, he rubs his hands together and, poof, mountains of gold
<name="bronn"> Let me guess Hes not a magician
<name="tyrion"> No
<name="bronn"> Hes stealing it?
<name="tyrion"> Worse, hes borrowing it
<name="bronn"> Whats wrong with that?
<name="tyrion"> We cant afford to pay it back, thats whats wrong with it The crown owes millions to my father
<name="bronn"> Seeing as its his grandsons ass on the throne, I imagine hell forgive that debt
<name="tyrion"> Forgive a debt, my father? For a man of the world, youre strangely naive
<name="bronn"> Ive never borrowed money before Im not clear on the rules
<name="tyrion"> Well Ahem! The basic principle is I lend you money, and after an agreed upon period of time, you return it with interest
<name="bronn"> And what if I dont?
<name="tyrion"> Well, you have to
<name="bronn"> But what if I dont?
<name="tyrion"> This is why I dont lend you money Anyway, its not my father Im worried about Its the Iron Bank of Braavos We owe them tens of millions If we fail to repay these loans, the bank will fund our enemies One way or another, they always get their gold back
<name="tyrion"> Ah, the return of the conquering hero Does he have a little jaunt in his step?
<name="bronn"> The lads practically skipping
<name="tyrion"> You were gone a long time I trust you got your moneys worth Or should I say my moneys worth?
<name="tyrion"> Oh, it was a gift, Podrick This is more than I give you in a year
<name="bronn"> Hes a squire You dont pay him
<name="tyrion"> Oh, then its much more than I give you in a year
<name="podrick"> They wouldnt take it, my lord
<name="bronn"> Maybe theyre trying to curry some favor with the new Master of Coin
<name="tyrion"> Have you ever known a whore to turn down gold? They were happy enough to take it when I gave it to them
<name="bronn"> What did you tell them?
<name="podrick"> I didnt tell them anything
<name="tyrion"> What did you do to them?
<name="podrick"> Lots of things
<name="tyrion"> And they seemed to like these things?
<name="podrick"> Yes, my lord
<name="bronn"> Of course they seemed to like it Theyre paid to seem to like it
<name="tyrion"> Only they werent paid
<name="bronn"> What are you saying? These ladies enjoyed him so much, they gave him the time for free?
<name="tyrion"> Is that what youre telling us? {PODRICK doesnt deny it
<name="tyrion"> Sit down, Podrick
<name="tyrion"> Were going to need details Copious details
<name="theon"> Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on
<name="soldier"> Ha! Ha

<name="locke"> I bet you did
<name="locke"> Your father, hed pay your weight in gold to get you back?
<name="jaime"> Youll be a rich man till the end of your days And your sons will be rich men and their sons after them Lands, titles youll have them all The North cant win this war Youre a smart man You understand that We have the numbers We have the gold
<name="locke"> Aye, you have both
<name="jaime"> Fighting bravely for a losing cause is admirable Fighting for a winning cause is far more rewarding
<name="locke"> Hard to argue with that
<name="jaime"> Now that were speaking together man to man, I wonder if you need to keep me chained to this tree Im not asking to be freed from my constraints, but if I could sleep lying down, my back would thank you for it Im not as young and resilient as I was once
<name="locke"> None of us are Unchain Ser Jaime from the tree
<name="man"> Come on, men
<name="locke"> Suppose youll be wanting something to eat

EPISODE "BREAKER OF CHAINS" - 20/04/2014


<name="cersei"> You did this You did this! As Sansa looks on, Ser Dontos Hollard approaches her
<name="ser dontos"> We have to leave
<name="cersei"> Take him! Take him
<name="cersei"> Where is his wife? Wheres Sansa?
<name="tywin"> Find her Bar the gates of the city Seize every ship in the harbor
<name="cersei"> Where is she?
<name="tywin"> No one leaves the capital! No one
<name="ser dontos"> Get in
<name="sansa"> Where are we going?
<name="ser dontos"> Somewhere safe
<name="ser dontos"> Up you go, my lady Youll be fine Youre stronger than you know
<name="sansa"> Lord Baelish?
<name="littlefinger"> Petyr Are you hurt, my lady?
<name="littlefinger"> Good Good Im sure youve had quite a fright Rest easy The worst is past Ser Dontos shouts up from his boat
<name="ser dontos"> Lord Baelish I promised Id get her to you safely
<name="littlefinger"> Softly, my friend Voices carry over water
<name="ser dontos"> I should get back before someone thinks to look for me LITTLEFINGER First youll want your pay 10,000 was it?
<name="ser dontos"> 10,000
<name="ser dontos"> Wait
<name="littlefinger"> Shh You dont want the queen to hear, do you? 1,000 gold cloaks are searching for you And if they found you, how do you think they would punish the girl who murdered the king?
<name="sansa"> I didnt murder anyone
<name="littlefinger"> I know I know But you must admit it looks suspicious The king who executed your father, who tormented you for years, and you fled the scene of his murder
<name="sansa"> Why did you kill him?
<name="littlefinger"> Because he was a drunk and a fool and I dont trust drunk fools
<name="sansa"> He saved me
<name="littlefinger"> Saved you? My lady, he followed my orders Every one of them And he did it all for gold Money buys a mans silence for a time A bolt in the heart buys it forever
<name="sansa"> He was helping me because I saved his life
<name="littlefinger"> Yes, and he gave you a priceless necklace that once belonged to his grandmother The last legacy of House Hollard
<name="littlefinger"> I had it made a few weeks ago What did I once tell you about the capital?
<name="sansa"> Were all liars here
<name="littlefinger"> Come, my lady I know youve had a difficult day But youre safe now I promise you that Youre safe with me and sailing home
<name="margaery"> So am I the queen?
<name="olenna"> More than you were with Renly Less than you would have been if Joffrey had done you the courtesy of consummating the marriage before dying In any case, this would not be an opportune moment to press the issue
<name="margaery"> Clawing at his own throat, looking to his mother to make stop it was horrible
<name="olenna"> The world is overflowing with horrible things But theyre all a tray of cakes next to death They brought me your grandfathers body when he died, you know? Made me look at it
<name="margaery"> What was it like?
<name="olenna"> They took me to the Great Hall and there he was The man Id married and suffered to father my children A great doughy lump Id sat next to at endless dinners and tedious gatherings There he was lying on a table
<name="margaery"> One of my husbands preferred the company of men and was stabbed through the heart Another was happiest torturing animals and was poisoned at our wedding feast I must be cursed
<name="olenna"> Nonsense Your circumstances have improved markedly You may not have enjoyed watching him die, but you enjoyed it more than you would have enjoyed being married to him, I can promise you that
<name="margaery"> But I would have been the queen
<name="olenna"> Our alliance with the Lannisters remains every bit as necessary to them as it is unpleasant for us You did wonderful work on Joffrey The next one should be easier
<name="tywin"> Your brother is dead Do you know what that means?
<name="tywin"> Im not trying to trick you
<name="tommen"> It means Ill become king
<name="tywin"> Yes, you will become king What kind of king do you think youll be?
<name="tommen"> A good king?
<name="tywin"> Mm, I think so as well Youve got the right temperament for it But what makes a good king? Hmm? What is a good kings single most important quality?
<name="cersei"> This is hardly the place or the time
<name="tommen"> Holiness?
<name="tywin"> Hmm Baelor the Blessed was holy And pious He built this sept He also named a six-year-old boy high septon because he thought the boy could work miracles He ended up fasting himself into an early grave because food was of this world and this world was sinful
<name="tommen"> Justice
<name="tywin"> Yeah A good king must be just Orys I was just Everyone applauded his reforms Nobles and commoners alike But he wasnt just for long He was murdered in his sleep after less than a year by his own brother Was that truly just of him? To abandon his subjects to an evil that he was too gullible to recognize?
<name="tommen"> No
<name="tywin"> No
<name="tommen"> What about strength?
<name="tywin"> Yes Strength King Robert was strong He won the rebellion and crushed the Targaryen dynasty And he attended three small council meetings in 17 years He spent his time whoring and hunting and drinking until the last two killed him So, we have a man who starves himself to death, a man who lets his own brother murder him, and a man who thinks that winning and ruling are the same thing What do they all lack?
<name="tommen"> Wisdom
<name="tywin"> Yes
<name="tommen"> Wisdom is what makes a good king
<name="tywin"> Yes But what is wisdom? Hmm? A house with great wealth and fertile lands asks you for your protection against another house with a strong Navy that could one day oppose you How do you know which choice is wise and which isnt? Youve any experience of treasuries and granaries or shipyards and soldiers?
<name="tommen"> No
<name="tywin"> No Of course not A wise king knows what he knows and what he doesnt Youre young A wise young king listens to his counselors and heeds their advice until he comes of age And the wisest kings continue to listen to them long afterwards Your brother was not a wise king Your brother was not a good king If he had been, perhaps hed still be alive Now, as the king, you will have to marry Do you understand why?
<name="tommen"> A king needs a queen
<name="tywin"> Yes, but why? To further the family line Do you know how that happens?
<name="tommen"> Yes
<name="tywin"> Yes, but has anyone explained the details to you?
<name="tommen"> I dont think so Its all relatively straightforward
<name="jaime"> How are you?
<name="tommen"> Im all right
<name="jaime"> You are You will be Ill see to that
<name="jaime"> Please give the queen a moment alone with her son
<name="high septon"> Yes, my lord All of you
<name="cersei"> It was Tyrion He killed him He told me he would A day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth Thats what he said to me You saw it You saw Joff point at him just before he.
<name="jaime"> I dont know what I saw
<name="cersei"> Avenge him Avenge our son Kill Tyrion
<name="jaime"> Tyrions my brother Our brother Therell be a trial Well get to the truth of what happened
<name="cersei"> I dont want a trial Hell squirm his way to freedom given the chance I want him dead Please, Jaime You have to He was our son Our baby boy
<name="jaime"> Youre a hateful woman Why have the gods made me love a hateful woman?
<name="cersei"> Jaime, not here, please Please
<name="cersei"> Stop it Stop it Stop
<name="jaime"> No
<name="cersei"> Stop it Stop
<name="cersei"> Stop Stop Its not right
<name="cersei"> Its not right Its not right
<name="jaime"> I dont care
<name="cersei"> Dont
<name="jaime"> I dont care
<name="cersei"> Dont Jaime, dont
<name="jaime"> I dont care
<name="arya"> Gonna rain soon Where are we?
<name="sandor"> Near Fairmarket, I think
<name="arya"> You think? You dont have a map?
<name="sandor"> No, I dont have a map
<name="arya"> Maybe we should get one
<name="sandor"> Just point out the next map shop you see and Ill buy you one

<name="sandor"> Believe me, girl, I want you there as soon as I can Get my gold, be on my way
<name="arya"> On your way where?
<name="sandor"> Why do you care? Might book passage across the Narrow Sea Fight as a sellsword Second Sons, could be Seems like a good fit for me
<name="arya"> Id like to see Braavos one day
<name="sandor"> Why Braavos?
<name="arya"> I have friends there
<name="sandor"> I doubt it
<name="farmer hamlet"> Seven blessings to you
<name="sandor"> What do you want?
<name="farmer hamlet"> What do I want? This is my land
<name="sandor"> If Im standing on it, its my land
<name="arya"> We were just watering the horses Well be on our way Forgive my father He was wounded fighting in the war Our cottage burned down while he was gone and my mother with it
<name="arya"> Hes never been the same
<name="farmer hamlet"> Which house did he fight for?
<name="arya"> The Tullys of Riverrun
<name="farmer hamlet"> Theres a storm coming Youll be wanting a roof tonight Theres fresh hay in the barn And Sally here makes rabbit stew just like her mom used to do We dont have much, but any man that bled for House Tully is welcome to it
<name="farmer hamlet"> We ask the Father to judge us with mercy accepting our human frailty We ask the Mother to bless our crops so we may feed ourselves and all who come to our door We ask the Warrior to give us courage in these days of strife and turmoil We ask the Maiden to protect Sallys virtue to keep her from the clutches of depravity
<name="sandor"> You got to do all seven of the fuckers?
<name="arya"> Father
<name="farmer hamlet"> We ask the Smith to strengthen our hands and our backs so we may finish the work required of us We ask the Crone to guide us on our journey from darkness to darkness
<name="sandor"> And we ask the Stranger not to kill us in our beds tonight for no damn reason at all
<name="arya"> Im so sorry
<name="arya"> Really good
<name="farmer hamlet"> Did you fight at the Twins?
<name="sandor"> Call that a fight? Slaughtering livestock more like
<name="farmer hamlet"> The Red Wedding theyre calling it Walder Frey committed sacrilege that day He shared bread and salt with the Starks He offered them guest right
<name="sandor"> Guest right dont mean much anymore
<name="farmer hamlet"> It means something to me The gods will have their vengeance Frey will burn in the seventh hell for what he did Things were different when Hoster Tully ruled the Riverlands We had good years and bad years, same as anyone But we were safe Now with the Freys, raiders come plundering, steal our food, steal our silver I was gonna send Sally north to stay with my brother, but the norths no better The whole countrys gone sour
<name="sandor"> You got any ale?
<name="farmer hamlet"> Afraid not
<name="sandor"> How can a man not keep ale in his home?
<name="farmer hamlet"> You look like you could really swing that sword A real warrior with proper training Those raiders wouldnt stand a chance against you How would it be if you stayed on till the new moon? I could use a man to help with the farmwork Sally does what she can, but she cant lift a bale of hay And if any thieves came looking for easy pickings, one look at you, Id bet theyd run the other way Meaning no offense
<name="sandor"> Whatll you pay? I dont have much But I have hidden a bit of silver from the bandits Fair wages for fair work?
<name="sandor"> Fair wages for fair work
<name="arya"> What did you do?
<name="sandor"> Get your horse saddled
<name="arya"> You told me you werent a thief
<name="sandor"> I wasnt

<name="sandor"> Aye, he took us in Hes a good man and his daughter makes a nice stew And theyll both be dead come winter
<name="arya"> You dont know that
<name="sandor"> I do know it Hes weak He cant protect himself Theyll both be dead come winter Dead men dont need silver
<name="arya"> Youre the worst shit in the Seven Kingdoms
<name="sandor"> Theres plenty worse than me I just understand the way things are How many Starks they got to behead before you figure it out?

<name="sam"> So are you all right? No one bothering you?
<name="gilly"> I get a lot of looks I hear them making their jokes But no ones touched me if thats what you mean
<name="sam"> I worry about it sometimes All the time
<name="gilly"> Why do you worry about it?
<name="sam"> 100 men, one woman

<name="gilly"> Are you bored of me?
<name="sam"> Bored of you? I I want to protect you
<name="gilly"> Ill get these to Hobb Keep an eye on little Sam
<name="davos"> Your Grace
<name="stannis"> Youre a literary man now What do you make of that?
<name="davos"> Joffrey?
<name="stannis"> The usurper Joffrey Baratheon I said those words when I tossed a leech into the fire A leech filled with bastard blood A bastard you set free I am now faced with a great opportunity and I am powerless to take advantage of it
<name="davos"> I will find you an army, Your Grace Ive been working day and night.
<name="stannis"> What progress have you made?
<name="davos"> Ive rallied House Peasebury to your cause
<name="stannis"> House Peasebury
<name="davos"> House Musgood
<name="stannis"> House Musgood
<name="davos"> And House Haigh
<name="stannis"> House Haigh They dont have enough men between them to raid a pantry
<name="davos"> Westeros is not the world, Your Grace We need to look east for ships and men 10,000 skilled soldiers fight for the Golden Company
<name="stannis"> The Golden Company?
<name="davos"> Theyve never broken a contract
<name="stannis"> Theyre sellswords
<name="davos"> Were willing to use blood magic to put you on the throne, but were not willing to pay men to fight? Now the Red Womans magic is real Her visions and prophecies may be, too, but Ive never heard of visions and prophecies winning a war Soldiers win wars Soldiers on the ground Its dirty on the ground
<name="stannis"> We dont have any gold
<name="davos"> Not yet
<name="stannis"> If I do not press my claim, my claim will be forgotten I will not become a page in someone elses history book Im running out of time, Ser Davos Which means youre running out of time
<name="shireen"> Youre late
<name="davos"> Im sorry, Princess
<name="shireen"> I thought you werent coming
<name="davos"> The Hand of the King doesnt have much leisure time
<name="shireen"> You wont be a very good Hand if you see the word knight and say ka-nigit
<name="davos"> That happened once, weeks ago Youre your fathers daughter, no mistake Bloody relentless, the both of you
<name="shireen"> Its a new one today Lots of tricky words But I think you can manage
<name="shireen"> Youll never read well if you move your lips Thats how children do it
<name="davos"> The Life and Adventures of Elyo Grivas First Sword of Braavos
<name="davos"> Thank you very much
<name="shireen"> I like this one Its full of sword fights and pirates You were a pirate once
<name="davos"> No, I was never a pirate I was a smuggler
<name="shireen"> Whats the difference?
<name="davos"> Well, if youre a famous smuggler, youre not doing it right
<name="shireen"> My father says a criminal is a criminal
<name="davos"> Your father lacks an appreciation of the finer points of bad behavior So do the Braavosi
<name="shireen"> Youve sailed to Braavos?
<name="davos"> Of course Almost got beheaded by a First Sword of Braavos I tried to explain to him the difference between pirates and smugglers, but he didnt seem any more interested in the distinction than your father I suppose if you work for the Iron Bank of Braavos and each one of your gold barges is worth half a kingdom, you tend not to be overly concerned with the kind of distinction.
<name="shireen"> What was that for?
<name="davos"> I need you to write a message
<name="shireen"> You should write it yourself Its good practice
<name="davos"> Its too important for me I need a smart person to do it Go on
<name="davos"> To the offices of the Iron Bank of Braavos from Stannis Baratheon the one true king of Westeros
<name="shireen"> But thats not you

<name="gilly"> You protected me north of the Wall
<name="sam"> This is different Theyre brothers of the Nights Watch and I cant just stab them in the back and I cant run away, which is what we did at Crasters
<name="sam"> You have to trust me Its for the best
<name="gilly"> Best for you
<name="sam"> Oh, Gilly Please dont
<name="oberyn"> Greedy
<name="ellaria"> No?
<name="olyvar"> Im sorry Youre lovely, I just never acquired the taste
<name="oberyn"> Youre calling my beauty an acquired taste?
<name="ellaria"> Thats quite all right, lover Its more for you
<name="oberyn"> Your loss
<name="olyvar"> You like them both the same? Boys and girls?
<name="oberyn"> Does that surprise you?
<name="olyvar"> Everyone has a preference
<name="oberyn"> Then everyone is missing half the worlds pleasure The gods made that and it delights me The gods made this and it delights me When it comes to war, I fight for Dorne When it comes to love, I dont choose sides
<name="olyvar"> I hope I have as much stamina when Im your age
<name="oberyn"> What are you, 25?
<name="ellaria"> Children
<name="oberyn"> Someday, if youre lucky, you will wake up and realize you are old That pretty ass of yours will sag Your belly will grow soft and your back will ache in the night and gray hairs will sprout from your ears No one will want you anymore Make sure you fucked your fill before that day
<name="olyvar"> Did you?
<name="ellaria"> He is a prince of Dorne Girls and boys will line up to fuck him till the day he dies
<name="oberyn"> They will all have to line up behind you
<name="tywin"> Prince Oberyn
<name="oberyn"> Lord Tywin
<name="tywin"> May we have the room?
<name="ellaria"> Call my name if you need me, lover
<name="oberyn"> Would you like to sit?
<name="tywin"> No, thank you
<name="oberyn"> Some wine?
<name="tywin"> No, thank you
<name="oberyn"> Im sorry about your grandson
<name="tywin"> Are you?
<name="oberyn"> I dont believe that a child is responsible for the sins of his father Or his grandfather An awful way to die
<name="tywin"> Which way is that?
<name="oberyn"> Are you interrogating me, Lord Tywin?
<name="tywin"> Some believe the king choked
<name="oberyn"> Some believe the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant The king was poisoned
<name="tywin"> I hear you studied poisons at the Citadel
<name="oberyn"> I did This is why I know
<name="tywin"> Your hatred for my family is rather well known You arrive at the capital, an expert in poisoning, some days later my grandson dies of poisoning
<name="oberyn"> Rather suspicious Why havent you thrown me in a dungeon?
<name="tywin"> You spoke with Tyrion in this very brothel on the day that you arrived What did you discuss?
<name="oberyn"> You think we conspired together?
<name="tywin"> What did you discuss?
<name="oberyn"> The death of my sister
<name="tywin"> For which you blame me
<name="oberyn"> She was raped and murdered by the Mountain The Mountain follows your orders Of course I blame you
<name="tywin"> Here I stand unarmed, unguarded Should I be concerned?
<name="oberyn"> You are unarmed and unguarded because you know me better than that I am a man of reason If I cut your throat today, I will be drawn and quartered tomorrow
<name="tywin"> Men at war commit all kinds of crimes without their superiors knowledge
<name="oberyn"> So you deny involvement in Elias murder?
<name="tywin"> Categorically
<name="oberyn"> I would like to speak with the Mountain
<name="tywin"> Im sure he would enjoy speaking with you
<name="oberyn"> He might not enjoy it as much as he thinks he would
<name="tywin"> I could arrange for this meeting
<name="oberyn"> But you want something in return
<name="tywin"> There will be a trial for my son And as custom dictates, three judges will render a verdict I will preside Mace Tyrell will serve as the second judge I would like you to be the third
<name="oberyn"> Why?
<name="tywin"> Not long ago, the Tyrells sided with Renly Baratheon Declared themselves enemies of the throne Now they are our strongest allies
<name="oberyn"> Well, you made the Tyrell girl a queen Asking me to judge at your sons trial isnt quite as tempting
<name="tywin"> I will also invite you to sit on the small council to serve as one of the new kings principal advisors
<name="oberyn"> I never realized you had such respect for Dorne, Lord Tywin
<name="tywin"> We are not the Seven Kingdoms until Dorne returns to the fold The king is dead The Greyjoys are in open rebellion A wildling army marches on the Wall And in the East, a Targaryen girl has three dragons Before long, she will turn her eyes to Westeros Only the Dornish managed to resist Aegon Targaryen and his dragons
<name="oberyn"> Youre saying you need us? That must be hard for you to admit
<name="tywin"> We need each other You help me serve justice to the kings assassins and I will help you serve justice to Elias
<name="tyrion"> Podrick Apologies for the stench
<name="podrick"> I brought you some wine, my lord, but they took it from me
<name="tyrion"> A noble effort
<name="podrick"> They didnt find the candles, though A quill, some parchment, duck sausage, almonds, and some hard cheese
<name="tyrion"> Youre a good lad Any word of Shae?
<name="podrick"> Ive heard nothing, my lord
<name="tyrion"> I suppose thats a good thing What are they saying about me out there?
<name="podrick"> Youre to stand trial in a fortnight for murdering the king
<name="tyrion"> Do you believe I murdered Joffrey?
<name="podrick"> No, my lord You didnt?
<name="tyrion"> No Gods, no The world is a better place without him, but I had nothing to do with it I would like to think if I were arranging a royal assassination, Id plan it in such a way that I wouldnt be standing there gawking like a fool when the king died Trial in a fortnight Have they announced the judges yet?
<name="podrick"> Your father
<name="tyrion"> Of course
<name="podrick"> Mace Tyrell
<name="tyrion"> Who will vote exactly as my father tells him to vote
<name="podrick"> And Prince Oberyn of Dorne
<name="tyrion"> Oberyn? Give it to my father He never fails to take advantage of a family tragedy
<name="podrick"> Im supposed to get a list of names from you, my lord Anyone who might testify on your behalf
<name="tyrion"> Oh, I can call my own witnesses? How generous of them Very well, my wife Sansa
<name="podrick"> My lord, shes gone
<name="tyrion"> Gone?
<name="podrick"> No ones seen her since the wedding You dont think she.
<name="tyrion"> No one had more cause to kill Joffrey than Sansa, but the girl is no assassin Whoever killed the king wanted me to lose my head for it And with my wifes disappearance, it makes me seem that much more guilty Podrick
<name="podrick"> Yes, my lord?
<name="tyrion"> Theyll be following you now
<name="podrick"> Who will?
<name="tyrion"> I dont know They They The ominous they The man pulling the strings Or woman My father Maybe Joffrey was too much work for him Sweet Tommen will be so much easier to handle Whenever something bad happens to me, I assume its my sister that had a hand in it But say what you will of Cersei, she loves her children She is the only one Im certain had nothing to do with this murder Which makes it unique as Kings Landing murders go
<name="podrick"> Any other witnesses, my lord?
<name="tyrion"> Varys could vouch for me if he dared
<name="podrick"> Hes already been called as a witness for the queen
<name="tyrion"> Of course Fetch Bronn I have a job for him
<name="podrick"> Ive already asked, my lord They wont let him see you
<name="tyrion"> Why not?
<name="podrick"> They say hes a known cutthroat and your close associate Hes under investigation himself
<name="tyrion"> And my brother? Will they at least allow me to see Jaime?
<name="podrick"> Ill ask, my lord
<name="podrick"> Theres something else, my lord A man, I didnt know his face, he came to ask if Id testify against you Said Id be named Ser Podrick Payne if I told the judges youd bought a poison called the Strangler
<name="tyrion"> Ser Podrick Payne? Has a nice ring to it What did you tell him?
<name="podrick"> I didnt tell them anything, my lord
<name="tyrion"> Are you going to accept their offer?
<name="podrick"> My lord
<name="tyrion"> Testifying against me wasnt a suggestion If they cant tempt you with honey, theyll choose something less sweet
<name="podrick"> Youve been good to me, my lord
<name="tyrion"> Pod, the trials in a fortnight Theyll want an answer before that
<name="podrick"> I already gave them an answer, my lord
<name="tyrion"> I will not have you dying on my behalf Do you hear me? If I have to take that long walk to the executioners block, I dont want to see your head already mounted
<name="podrick"> My lord
<name="tyrion"> Pod, I am giving you an order Go and find my brother Tell him I need him And get yourself out of Kings Landing before its too late Pod! This is farewell
<name="podrick"> Farewell, my lord
<name="tyrion"> Pod There has never lived a more loyal squire
<name="olly"> Mother says its time to eat
<name="guymon"> Whats she got boiling? Wait Wait Let me guess
<name="olly"> Potatoes
<name="guymon"> Potatoes Well, no one boils a potato better than your mom Has she got.
<name="man"> The wildlings
<name="ollys mother"> Guymon! Hide Hide
<name="styr"> You know how to get to Castle Black?
<name="olly"> Yes Yes
<name="styr"> Those your parents? Open your eyes Im going to eat them Do you hear me? Im going to eat your dead mama and Im going to eat your dead papa Go tell the crows at Castle Black
<name="yarwyck"> We need to teach them a lesson about the way we deal with their kind
<name="men"> Aye! Aye
<name="yarwyck"> Three dozen bodies with slit throats tossed off the top of the Wall Seems like that would be a good lesson
<name="men"> Aye
<name="alliser thorne"> If we go after them, well be giving them what they want They want to draw us out, pick us off a few at a time
<name="maester aemon"> We have just over 100 men And thats including stewards and builders And me We cant afford to lose a single man We must remember our first responsibility We are the watchers on the Wall
<name="pyp"> Theres got to be a way to protect them
<name="alliser thorne"> Youre a champion of the common people, Lord Snow What do you say to Brother Pyps proposition?
<name="jon"> Mance Rayder is coming If the wildlings breach the Wall, theyll roll over everything and everyone for 1,000 Miles before they reach an army that can stop them
<name="alliser thorne"> We need to shore up Castle Black and we need to defend the Wall That is our job
<name="pyp"> Rangers returning
<name="jon"> Help him
<name="dolorous edd"> Thought youd have blue eyes by now
<name="alliser thorn"> What took you so long?
<name="grenn"> We were held up
<name="alliser thorn"> By what?
<name="grenn"> Chains
<name="dolorous edd"> We were guests of the mutineers at Crasters Keep
<name="jon"> And the mutineers stayed?
<name="dolorous edd"> Theyre not going anywhere Theyve got Crasters food and his wives Poor girls Never thought theyd miss their daddy Karls running things now Hes the one who put a knife through Crasters mouth
<name="jon"> We need to ride north and kill them all
<name="alliser thorn"> We just went over this, boy -Justice can wait
<name="jon"> Its not about justice I told the wildlings we had over 1,000 men at Castle Black alone Karl and the others know the truth as well as we do How long do you think theyll keep that information to themselves when the wildlings are peeling their fingernails off? Mance has all he needs to crush us, he just doesnt know it yet As soon as he gets his hands on them, he will Then hell throw his full strength at us And even if every one of us kills 100 wildlings, theres still not a thing we can do to stop them
<name="pyp"> I dont think I can kill 100 wildlings
<name="daenerys"> Are they attacking?
<name="jorah"> A single rider A champion of Meereen They want you to send your own champion against him
<name="daenerys"> What is he doing?
<name="barristan selmy"> I believe he means to.
<name="missandei"> He says that were an army of men without man parts He claims you are no woman at all, but a man who hides his cock in his own asshole
<name="barristan selmy"> Ignore him, Your Grace These are meaningless words
<name="jorah"> Theyre not meaningless if half the city you intend to take is listening to them
<name="daenerys"> I have something to say to the people of Meereen First, I will need this one to be quiet Do I have a champion?
<name="grey worm"> Allow me this honor, mother of dragons I will not disappoint you
<name="daenerys"> You are the commander of the Unsullied I cannot risk you
<name="barristan selmy"> Your Grace, Ive won more single combats than any man alive
<name="daenerys"> Which is why you must remain by my side
<name="jorah"> Ive been by your side longer than any of them, Khaleesi Let me stand for you today as well
<name="daenerys"> You are my most trusted advisor, my most valued general, and my dearest friend I will not gamble with your life
<name="daario"> I was the last to join your army Im not your general or a member of your Queensguard or the commander of your Unsullied My mother was a whore I come from nothing And before long, I will return to nothing Let me kill this man for you
<name="daenerys"> Very well You have quite an audience Make it worth their while
<name="missandei"> He is very brave, Your Grace
<name="daenerys"> Yes, win or lose, as long as the whole city is watching
<name="daenerys"> You sure you dont want a horse?
<name="daario"> Why would I want a horse?
<name="daenerys"> Horses are faster than men
<name="daario"> Horses are dumber than men
<name="daenerys"> I am Daenerys Stormborn
<name="daenerys"> Your Masters may have told you lies about me, or they may have told you nothing It does not matter I have nothing to say to them Only to you First I went to Astapor Those who were slaves in Astapor now stand behind me, free Next I went to Yunkai Those who were slaves in Yunkai now stand behind me, free Now I have come to Meereen I am not your enemy Your enemy is beside you

<name="barristan"> The old houses will flock to our queen when she crosses the Narrow Sea
<name="jorah"> The old houses will flock to whichever side they think will win, as they always have
<name="jorah"> Theres other news From Yunkai Without the Unsullied to enforce your rule, the Wise Masters have retaken control of the city Theyve reenslaved the freedmen who stayed behind and sworn to take revenge against you And in Astapor, the council you installed to rule over the city has been overthrown by a butcher named Cleon whos declared himself His Imperial Majesty
<name="daenerys"> Please leave me Not you, Jorah
<name="daenerys"> It appears my liberation of Slavers Bay isnt going quite as planned
<name="jorah"> You could sail for Westeros and leave it all behind A boy sits on the Iron Throne A boy many believe to be a bastard with no right to it Theyve never been more vulnerable
<name="daenerys"> You counseled me against rashness once in Qarth I didnt listen That all worked out well
<name="daenerys"> How can I rule seven kingdoms if I cant control Slavers Bay? Why should anyone trust me? Why should anyone follow me?
<name="jorah"> Youre a Targaryen Youre the Mother of Dragons
<name="daenerys"> I need to be more than that I will not let those I have freed slide back into chains I will not sail for Westeros
<name="jorah"> What, then?
<name="daenerys"> I will do what queens do I will rule Outside the Aerie
<name="littlefinger"> Pull up your hood A memorable shade
<name="sansa"> But how would they know?
<name="littlefinger"> You know what kind of stories poor men enjoy the most? Ones about rich girls theyll never meet
<name="sansa"> Is this the only way into the Eyrie?
<name="littlefinger"> The mountains are impassable If you want to get to the Eyrie, you need to go through the Bloody Gate It doesnt matter how large your army is, if you attack this gate, you do it on this road, three men abreast and get slaughtered like goats The first Lords of the Vale didnt have much, but they had these mountains and they knew how to use them And the fortress they built here has never been overcome Not once in 1,000 years Know your strengths, use them wisely, and one man can be worth 10,000
<name="knight"> Who would pass the Bloody Gate?
<name="littlefinger"> Lord Petyr Baelish and his niece Alayne
<name="knight"> Stand to
<name="knight"> Stand to
<name="knight"> Stand to
<name="knight"> Welcome back, Lord Baelish
<name="robin"> Uncle Petyr
<name="littlefinger"> My lord
<name="littlefinger"> Oh I have brought you a gift
<name="lysa"> Lord Baelish
<name="littlefinger"> My lady
<name="robin"> Look what Uncle Petyr brought me
<name="lysa"> A beautiful gift for a beautiful boy
<name="sansa"> Its a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Lady Arryn My name is Al.
<name="lysa"> Oh, do take down that hood, child Dont you think know who you are? You think Id let my intended leave the Eyrie on urgent business without knowing what that business was? I let him go so he could bring you here to me
<name="lysa"> My flesh and blood
<name="sansa"> Its wonderful to meet you, Aunt Lysa
<name="lysa"> You mustnt call me that in front of anyone else
<name="sansa"> Of course I understand
<name="lysa"> No one can know youre here It would put us in a very precarious position
<name="sansa"> I would never say a thing
<name="lysa"> The Lannisters want to destroy us Theyve been trying for years Now they know what it feels like
<name="robin"> Mummy said they killed your mother and they chopped off your brothers head
<name="sansa"> They did, and my fathers
<name="robin"> They killed my father, too, with poison I wanted to make the little Lannister baby man fly, but Mother said I couldnt
<name="sansa"> Make him fly?
<name="robin"> Through the Moon Door
<name="lysa"> And on top of everything else, they made you marry that filthy troll
<name="sansa"> They did They made us both Lord Tyrion didnt want to
<name="lysa"> I dont believe that for a moment Did he force himself on you?
<name="sansa"> No We never.
<name="lysa"> Good Robin, this is your cousin Sansa But youre not to call her Sansa in front of anyone but Uncle Petyr and myself Do you understand? Sansa, this is my son Robin
<name="sansa"> Its a pleasure to meet you, Robin
<name="lysa"> Robin, show Sansa to her chamber Take the back stairs
<name="littlefinger"> Go Well speak soon
<name="lysa"> What took you so long?
<name="littlefinger"> Arranging for the ascension of King Tommen I, extricating Sansa, getting her here alive
<name="lysa"> Shes here Weve spent more than enough time on her for one evening
<name="lysa"> Lets get married tonight
<name="littlefinger"> Ought we not inform the Lords of the Vale about the ceremony?
<name="lysa"> Theres only one Lord of the Vale The others can all hang Lurking and simpering on the stairs like buzzards the moment my husband died, trying to get their claws in me
<name="littlefinger"> I do think that we could wait until.
<name="lysa"> Im done waiting, Petyr We had our wedding night many years ago Or dont you remember?
<name="littlefinger"> Like it was yesterday
<name="lysa"> What wife would do for you the things Ive done for you? What wife would trust you the way Ive trusted you? When you gave me those drops and told me to pour them into Jons wine, my husbands wine when you told me to write a letter to Cat telling her it was the Lannisters.
<name="littlefinger"> The deed is done Faded into nothing Only speaking of it can make it real
<name="littlefinger"> Tonight it is, then
<name="littlefinger"> Let me bathe and dress for the occasion Once Im presentable, Ill call on the septon immediately
<name="lysa"> Im warning you Im going to scream when my husband makes love to me Im going to scream so loud, theyll hear me clear across the Narrow Sea
<name="tywin"> When will the wedding take place in your mind?
<name="cersei"> As soon as decency permits After weve allowed Tommen the appropriate time to mourn his brother and Margaery to mourn her husband
<name="tywin"> A fortnight?
<name="cersei"> That seems reasonable
<name="tywin"> No jugglers, no jousting dwarves, no 77-course meals
<name="tywin"> And your wedding to Loras?
<name="cersei"> Shortly after Tommens
<name="tywin"> Shortly?
<name="cersei"> A fortnight
<name="tywin"> I know you dont like them I didnt like your husband Used to pat me on the back a lot I didnt trust him
<name="cersei"> We had that in common
<name="tywin"> You dont need to make formal alliances with people you trust
<name="cersei"> Then whom can we trust?
<name="tywin"> Ourselves alone
<name="tywin"> The Tyrells are our only true rivals in terms of resources and we need them on our side
<name="cersei"> Robert wasnt particularly rich
<name="tywin"> Robert had me funding him Wars swallow gold like a pit in the earth
<name="cersei"> I suppose that explains why we did so well in the last one
<name="tywin"> Do you know how much gold was mined in the Westerlands this past year?
<name="cersei"> Havent a clue
<name="tywin"> Go on, your best guess
<name="cersei"> Pounds, tons, ounces?
<name="tywin"> Doesnt matter The answer is the same
<name="cersei"> That cant be
<name="tywin"> Our last working mine ran dry three years ago
<name="cersei"> Then how do we pay for anything?
<name="tywin"> The crown owes the Iron Bank of Braavos a tremendous amount of money
<name="cersei"> How much?
<name="tywin"> A tremendous amount
<name="cersei"> There must be someone at the Iron Bank you can speak to, come to some arrangement
<name="tywin"> The Iron Bank is the Iron Bank There is no someone
<name="cersei"> Someone does work there It is comprised of people
<name="tywin"> And a temple is comprised of stones One stone crumbles and another takes its place And the temple holds its form for 1,000 years or more Thats what the Iron Bank is a temple We all live in its shadow and almost none of us know it You cant run from them You cant cheat them You cant sway them with excuses If you owe them money and you dont want to crumble yourself, you pay it back Vesting the Tyrells in the crown will help a great deal in this respect
<name="cersei"> Its for the good of the family, I understand that Im not sure my brothers do
<name="tywin"> I know youre building a strong case against Tyrion And as a mother, that is your right But as a judge, I cannot discuss the trial with you
<name="cersei"> I respect that We dont need to discuss it
<name="cersei"> The Lannister legacy is the only thing that matters Youve started wars to protect this family Turned your back on Jaime for refusing to contribute to its future What does Tyrion deserve for lighting that future on fire?
<name="arya"> Joffrey Cersei Walder Frey Meryn Trant Tywin Lannister The Red Woman Beric Dondarrion Thoros of Myr Ilyn Payne The Mountain
<name="sandor"> Would you shut up?
<name="arya"> I cant sleep until I say the names
<name="sandor"> The names of every fucking person in Westeros?
<name="arya"> Only the ones Im going to kill
<name="sandor"> Hates as good a thing as any to keep a person going Better than most We come across my brother, maybe we can both cross a name off our list
<name="arya"> If he were here right now, what would you do?
<name="sandor"> Id tell him to shut the fuck up so I can get some sleep Go on, get it over with, your list of doomed men
<name="arya"> Im almost done Only one name left
<name="sandor"> Go on
<name="arya"> The Hound
<name="sansa"> Thank you
<name="lysa"> Your mother always had a sweet tooth, you know?
<name="sansa"> Really?
<name="lysa"> Oh, yes At suppertime, she would go straight for honey cakes, candied almonds, custard Anything sweet Eventually, your grandfather had to assign a septa to watch her at meals Cat was the firstborn daughter after all It was important that she remain desirable so Father could arrange a good match for her and she was starting to get fat
<name="sansa"> My mother fat? She never let me have my pudding until Id finished all my proper food
<name="lysa"> This is before she married your father and moved to the North By the time you were born, your fathers austerity had become hers Marriage changes people I didnt mean for you to stop Go on, enjoy them How do you like them?
<name="sansa"> Theyre delicious Where did you get the lemons? You cant grow them up here
<name="lysa"> Oh, gods, no Petyr had three crates brought all the way from Kings Landing He knew you liked lemon cakes Hes so kind He really cares for you Think where youd be without him In their clutches and tried for murder
<name="sansa"> Yes Im very lucky
<name="lysa"> He feels responsible for you
<name="sansa"> Oh, I know he does Im so grateful
<name="lysa"> Why? Why does he feel responsible for you?
<name="sansa"> Well, Im half Tully He loved your family so much
<name="lysa"> Loved your mother
<name="sansa"> No
<name="lysa"> Thats what you wanted to say
<name="sansa"> He loves you, Aunt Lysa Hes married to you
<name="lysa"> Your mother never loved him Never Cat always went straight for the sweetest thing The most obvious thing Your Uncle Brandon Your handsome, arrogant, cruel Uncle Brandon He almost killed Petyr in a duel And your mother loved him anyway And now Petyr is risking his life to save you, the daughter of a woman who didnt love him no more than those whores in his brothels Has he told you about them?
<name="sansa"> No
<name="lysa"> He hasnt told you about the vile things they do with their bodies? The vile things they let him do with their bodies?
<name="sansa"> No, never
<name="lysa"> Are you pregnant?
<name="sansa"> What? No, I told you Lord Tyrion and I never.
<name="lysa"> I wasnt asking about Tyrion What have you let Petyr do with your body?
<name="sansa"> Aunt Lysa, no, I.
<name="lysa"> Your young, pretty body
<name="sansa"> Nothing Im a virgin
<name="lysa"> Dont lie to me
<name="sansa"> Youre hurting me
<name="lysa"> Ill know if you lie
<name="sansa"> Im a virgin, I swear it He loves you, Aunt Lysa All he says is that Im stupid Im a stupid little girl with stupid dreams who never learns and Im a terrible liar, so I should always tell the truth And I swear to you that he has never touched me Not once, not ever
<name="lysa"> Shh Shh Shh Its all right It will all be all right Youll be a widow soon Theyll execute that dwarf for murdering the king and youll be free to marry Robin Youll be the Lady of the Vale Hmm ingsroad
<name="brienne"> Didnt they teach you how to ride a horse?
<name="podrick"> Yes, my lady, when I was young There wasnt much call for it with Lord Tyrion, though He preferred litters
<name="brienne"> Perhaps you should have stayed with him Its not going to be a pleasant journey for you It could take weeks to get to the Wall, depending on the weather
<name="podrick"> Thats a long way off
<name="brienne"> Well, Lady Sansas brothers at Castle Black If I were her, thats where Id go Feel free to stop at any point
<name="podrick"> Never, my lady Im your squire
<name="brienne"> Ive made it this far in the world without a squire I dont see why I need one now
<name="podrick"> All knights have squires, my lady
<name="brienne"> Im not a knight And Im not a slaver, either I dont own you
<name="podrick"> I swore an oath, my lady
<name="brienne"> I am releasing you from that oath That means you could leave

<name="jaime"> You threw your life away You threw it away Its not a joke You understand that, dont you?
<name="tyrion"> Of course its a joke, just not a very funny one I couldnt I couldnt listen to her standing there telling her lies I couldnt do it
<name="jaime"> You fell in love with a whore
<name="tyrion"> Yes, I fell in love with a whore And I was stupid enough to think that she had fallen in love with me That deal you made, it was everything Father wanted You do see that? He gets you back as his heir The future Lord of the Rock And he ships me off to Castle Black, out of sight at last All so perfect It felt good to take that from him He knows Im innocent and hes willing to sacrifice me anyway Hes willing to sacrifice any of us Not you Youre the golden son You could kill a king, lose a hand, fuck your own sister, youll always be the golden son
<name="jaime"> Careful Im the last friend youve got
<name="tyrion"> At least I got to tell them what they really are
<name="jaime"> Yes, brilliant speech Theyll be talking about it for days to come I thought you were a realist Didnt realize youd die for pride
<name="tyrion"> Dont give up on me just yet I survived one trial by combat, even though you werent there to save me
<name="jaime"> I cant save you this time either My training has proved that I cant beat a stable boy with my left hand
<name="tyrion"> Wheres your sense of adventure? Even if you lose, imagine the look on Fathers face when you fall
<name="tyrion"> Our family name snuffed out with a single swing of the sword
<name="jaime"> It is tempting
<name="tyrion"> Well Bronn fought for me once, hell do it again If he wins, I expect Ill be in his debt for the rest of my life
<name="jaime"> If he wins

<name="man"> Didnt think Id see you again
<name="sam"> All right, Jon?
<name="man"> Welcome back, brother
<name="alliser"> Lord Snow
<name="alliser"> This is no place for wild beasts Lock him away or Ill let Hobb throw him in tonights stew
<name="jon"> Come on, Ghost
<name="jon"> Mances army was closing in on Crasters Keep when we left We saw their campfires from Osrics Hill Theyll reach the Wall before the next full moon
<name="janos slynt"> Im surprised you didnt ride over and say hello ing-beyond-the-Wall is your old friend, isnt he?
<name="jon"> We need to prepare
<name="alliser"> Weve been preparing
<name="jon"> We should seal the tunnel Plug it with rocks and ice Flood it and let it freeze
<name="alliser"> And how would we range north?
<name="jon"> We wouldnt
<name="alliser"> Coward You would cut off our legs, pluck out our eyes, leave us cowering behind the Wall hoping for the storm to pass?
<name="grenn"> We cant defend the gate against 100,000 men
<name="alliser"> This castle has stood for thousands of years The Nights Watch has defended her for thousands of years And in all those centuries, we have never sealed the tunnel
<name="jon"> Have you ever seen a giant, Ser Alliser? I have
<name="alliser"> The bars on those gates are four inches thick Cold-rolled steel
<name="jon"> They wont stop them
<name="alliser"> Remind me which order you belong to, Lord Snow
<name="jon"> The stewards
<name="alliser"> Are the stewards responsible for maintaining the tunnel?
<name="jon"> No
<name="alliser"> Who would that be?
<name="jon"> The builders
<name="alliser"> Ah, the builders First Builder Yarwyck, Lord Snow here recommends sealing the tunnel, leaving us unable to carry out our duties as sworn brothers of the Nights Watch Do you agree with him?
<name="yarwick"> No
<name="alliser"> Given your deep knowledge of the wildling army, Lord Snow, you and Tarly will take night duties atop the Wall until the full moon
<name="alliser"> Moving on First Builder, well need 100 barrels of pitch brought atop the wall
<name="yarwick"> Aye
<name="bronn"> My lord
<name="tyrion"> You have new clothes
<name="bronn"> Do you like em? Eh? Gloves are doeskin Softer than a virgins thighs
<name="tyrion"> I sent for you days ago
<name="bronn"> Ive been a bit busy
<name="tyrion"> Doing what?
<name="bronn"> My lonesome bachelor days are over Im to wed Lollys Stokeworth
<name="tyrion"> Lollys Stokeworth? She doesnt strike me as your sort of girl
<name="bronn"> I wouldnt say I had a single sort of girl
<name="tyrion"> Shes dim-witted
<name="bronn"> If I wanted wits, Id marry you
<name="tyrion"> When my sister arranged this love match, did she mention that Lollys has an older sister?
<name="bronn"> Falyse Aye, I did know about the older sister
<name="tyrion"> And you understand the rules of inheritance?
<name="bronn"> Falyse is 40 and barren
<name="tyrion"> She still gets Castle Stokeworth when her father dies
<name="bronn"> She does Unless she happens to perish before her father Then Lollys gets the castle
<name="bronn"> What? Ladies fall from their horses and snap their pretty necks all the time
<name="tyrion"> You and my sister deserve each other Why did you bother to come here?
<name="bronn"> You once said if anyone ever asked me to sell you out, youd double their price
<name="tyrion"> Is it two wives you want or two castles?
<name="bronn"> One of each will do But if you want me to kill the Mountain for you, itd better be a damn big castle
<name="tyrion"> Im a bit short on castles at the moment But I can offer you gold and gratitude
<name="bronn"> I have gold What can I buy with gratitude?
<name="tyrion"> You might be surprised A Lannister always pays his debts
<name="bronn"> Your sisters a Lannister, too
<name="tyrion"> My wife is heir to Winterfell If I emerge from this with my head still on my shoulders, I may one day rule the North in her name I could carve you out a big piece of it
<name="bronn"> If and may and could Its bloody cold up north Lollys is soft and warm And close If I gave you the choice between fucking Lollys and fighting the Mountain, youd have your britches down and your cock out before I could blink
<name="tyrion"> Does he frighten you so much?
<name="bronn"> Id be a bloody fool if he didnt frighten me Hes freakish big and freakish strong And quicker than youd expect for a man of that size Maybe I could take him, dance around until hes so tired of hacking at me, he dropped his sword, get him off his feet somehow But one misstep and Im dead Why should I risk it?
<name="tyrion"> Because youre my friend
<name="bronn"> Aye, Im your friend And when have you ever risked your life for me?
<name="bronn"> I like you, pampered little shit that you are I just like myself more
<name="tyrion"> I understand
<name="bronn"> Im sorry it has to be this way
<name="tyrion"> Why are you sorry? Because youre an evil bastard with no conscience and no heart? Thats what I liked about you in the first place
<name="bronn"> We had some good days together
<name="tyrion"> Yes, we did
<name="bronn"> What will you do?
<name="tyrion"> I suppose Ill have to kill the Mountain myself Wont that make for a great song?
<name="bronn"> I hope to hear them sing it one day
<name="daenerys"> How did you get in here? Your door is well guarded
<name="daario"> but your window is not
<name="daario"> I swam to an island a mile offshore for these
<name="daenerys"> Dont do that again
<name="daario"> Never met a woman who didnt like wildflowers
<name="daenerys"> These are my private quarters If I want you here, I will summon you
<name="daario"> Forgive me, my queen I live to serve you
<name="daenerys"> Tell me why youre here
<name="daario"> I came to ask a favor I only have two talents in this world war and women You are staying here in Meereen to rule That is a wise decision I respect it But here in Meereen, I cannot pursue my talents
<name="daenerys"> Ive ordered the Second Sons to patrol the streets to stop the revenge killing
<name="daario"> Youve ordered us to be night watchmen
<name="daenerys"> And as for women, there are thousands in Meereen you can pursue
<name="daario"> There is only one, and she does not want me
<name="daenerys"> You swore me your sword
<name="daario"> My sword is yours till the day I die
<name="daenerys"> So if I command you to stay in Meereen and patrol the streets?
<name="daario"> Ill stay in Meereen and patrol the streets Send me to kill your enemies Any enemy anywhere Let me do what I do best
<name="daenerys"> Very well
<name="daenerys"> Do what you do best
<name="daenerys"> Take off your clothes
<name="selyse"> Oh
<name="melisandre"> Come in, my queen Please
<name="selyse"> I didnt mean to disturb you, my lady
<name="melisandre"> You could never disturb me
<name="selyse"> I just wanted to speak with you before we left
<name="melisandre"> Could you bring me that vial over there? The blue one
<name="melisandre"> No, no, no Not that one You dont even want to touch that one Next to it Thats the one
<name="melisandre"> When I looked into the flames this morning, the Lord spoke to me He said, Tonight, you will have your last good bath in a long while Make it count A joke Not a very good one, Im afraid
<name="selyse"> It was I humor isnt my strength
<name="melisandre"> Thats because most jokes are lies and youre devoted to the truth
<name="selyse"> If theyre lies, my lady, arent they best avoided?
<name="melisandre"> Not always
<name="melisandre"> Most of these powders and potions are lies Deceptions to make men think they witnessed our Lords power Once they step into his light, they will see the lie for what it was a trick that lead them to the truth A pinch of this powder in a bonfire will send a flaming column screaming towards the sky And this one creates a black smoke that will make the bravest man piss himself with fear And a drop of this in any mans wine will drive him wild with lust
<name="selyse"> Did you use it with Stannis?
<name="melisandre"> No Dont be upset Men never crave what they already have
<name="melisandre"> Its only flesh It needs what it needs
<name="selyse"> No act done in service of the Lord can ever be called a sin I thank God every day for bringing you to us And Stannis to you He wants to bring Shireen with us I think that would be ill-advised My daughter has heretical tendencies, as youre well aware I dont know if her doubt is real or simply meant to spite me, but whichever the case, she should stay home
<name="melisandre"> I understand how you feel
<name="selyse"> Hmm
<name="melisandre"> But that is impossible
<name="selyse"> Why?
<name="melisandre"> You dont need powders and potions, my queen You dont need lies You are strong enough to look into the Lords light and see his truth for yourself
<name="melisandre"> However harsh it is However hard for us to understand You dont need my help, but I will need yours soon When we set sail, your daughter must be with us The Lord needs her
<name="daario"> Jorah the Andal Are you here to see our queen? Shes in a good mood
<name="jorah"> Khaleesi
<name="daenerys"> Youre here early
<name="jorah"> Later than some
<name="daenerys"> You dont approve?
<name="jorah"> Its not a question of approval, its a question of trust
<name="daenerys"> You neither approve nor trust
<name="jorah"> Why would I? The mans a sellsword
<name="daenerys"> Didnt you fight for the Golden Company before pledging your sword to my brother?
<name="jorah"> I did
<name="daenerys"> I trust you
<name="jorah"> Daario Naharis killed his captains and dumped their heads at your feet when he grew tired of their commands How could you ever have faith in a man like that?
<name="daenerys"> I could never have faith in a man like Daario Thats why Ive sent him and the Second Sons to retake Yunkai
<name="jorah"> You have?
<name="daenerys"> I have
<name="jorah"> Without you there to rule, Khaleesi, I fear the masters will simply bide their time, wait for the invaders to leave and reassert control
<name="daenerys"> That is why Ive ordered Daario to execute every master in Yunkai The masters tear babies from their mothers arms They mutilate little boys by the thousands They train little girls in the art of pleasuring old men They treat men like beasts, as you said yourself
<name="jorah"> Herding the masters into pens and slaughtering them by the thousands is also treating men like beasts The slaves you freed, brutality is all theyve ever known If you want them to know something else, youll have to show it to them
<name="daenerys"> And repay the slavers with what? Kindness? A fine? A stern warning?
<name="jorah"> Its tempting to see your enemies as evil, all of them, but theres good and evil on both sides in every war ever fought
<name="daenerys"> Let the priests argue over good and evil Slavery is real I can end it I will end it And I will end those behind it
<name="jorah"> I sold men into slavery, Khaleesi
<name="daenerys"> And now you are helping me show them to freedom
<name="jorah"> I wouldnt be here to help you if Ned Stark had done to me what you want to do to the masters of Yunkai
<name="daenerys"> The man who came to me the other day about burying his father
<name="jorah"> Hizdahr zo Loraq?
<name="daenerys"> He will accompany the Second Sons and serve as my ambassador to Yunkai He will tell the masters what has happened in Meereen He will explain the choice they have before them They can live in my new world or they can die in their old one
<name="daenerys"> Well, go and catch Daario before he leaves Tell him I changed my mind
<name="jorah"> Yes, Khaleesi
<name="daenerys"> No Tell him you changed my mind
<name="sandor"> Rat cunts Fucking whore
<name="arya"> Youre doing it wrong You need to burn away that horrible bit there Otherwise its gonna get infected and fester I know you dont like fire, but if you dont do it right-
<name="sandor"> No fire
<name="arya"> Itll only take a second It wont hurt that much
<name="sandor"> No fire
<name="sandor"> Shut up about it Shut up about everything Thanks to you, Im a walking bag of silver anywhere the Lannisters hold sway Which is everywhere between where we are now and where were going
<name="sandor"> Im as stupid as that hog you stuck back in the village, getting myself cut and stabbed and bitten No reward is worth this much trouble Wish Id never laid eyes on you You say your brother gave you that sword
<name="sandor"> My brother gave me this It was just like you said a while back Pressed me to the fire like I was a nice juicy mutton chop
<name="arya"> Why?
<name="sandor"> Thought I stole one of his toys I didnt steal it I was just playing with it The pain was bad The smell was worse But the worst thing was that it was my brother who did it My father, who protected him told everyone my bedding caught fire You think youre on your own?
<name="arya"> Let me wash it out and help you sew it up at least
<name="brienne"> Bit of comfort never hurt anyone Weve been sleeping in ditches the last few weeks I think we can treat ourselves to a featherbed for the night and a hot meal not cooked by you
<name="podrick"> Couldnt agree more, my lady
<name="brienne"> Just dont start expecting silk underclothes Not working for your former lord any longer
<name="podrick"> Yes, my lady
<name="brienne"> Dont get drunk
<name="podrick"> No, my lady
<name="hot pie"> Can I get you anything else?
<name="brienne"> No, this will do nicely, thank you Kidney pie is wonderful
<name="hot pie"> Thanks I do my best
<name="hot pie"> A good kidney pie is all about the ingredients Flour, lard, water, eggs, milk Easy enough But the meat, peacetime or not, getting your hands on a good bottom round steak and calves kidneys is not easy I mean, some people settle for plain old beef kidneys Got no right to cook anything, them Oh, and the gravy Dont get me started on the gravy Very difficult to get right See, a lot of people give up on the gravy You cannot give up on the gravy No gravy, no pie Simple as that Thats nice armor Are you a knight?
<name="brienne"> No
<name="hot pie"> Oh, its just people with armor are usually knights Generally speaking From Kings Landing, though, arent you? From there myself originally Flea Bottom born and bred What brings you to these parts?
<name="brienne"> Were looking for someone
<name="hot pie"> Someone in particular? Maybe they came in here A lot of people come in here Just the other day we had 17-
<name="brienne"> A girl, tall, red hair, very pretty Her name is Sansa Stark, but she may be using a different name
<name="hot pie"> Starks? What, like them lot from Winterhell ?
<name="hot pie"> sNo, aint seen anyone like that I heard they was all traitors Dont need no traitors in here
<name="brienne"> I pledged my life to their mother Catelyn Stark I swore to her Id bring her daughters home
<name="hot pie"> Sure I cant get you a bit more kidney pie?
<name="brienne"> What?
<name="podrick"> Its nothing, my lady
<name="brienne"> You wouldnt be screwing your face up like that if it was nothing
<name="podrick"> Dont want to offend, my lady Truly, I dont
<name="brienne"> Youre not interesting enough to be offensive
<name="podrick"> The Lannisters want Lady Sansa The Lannisters have money People kill for money I dont think we should be telling people were searching for Lady Sansa
<name="hot pie"> My lady My lord Could I have a word?
<name="brienne"> What about? Not kidney pie
<name="hot pie"> You seem like a proper lady Someone who could be trusted I never met no Sansa Stark But I know her sister Arya
<name="brienne"> No ones seen Arya Stark since her father was beheaded Shes presumed dead
<name="hot pie"> She werent when I last spoke to her
<name="brienne"> When was that?
<name="hot pie"> Heading up north with the Nights Watch She was all dressed up as a boy Like your ladyship, only without the armor Going by the name Arry
<name="brienne"> So what happened to her?
<name="hot pie"> Well-
<name="brienne"> The quick version
<name="hot pie"> The Lannisters took us prisoner We escaped The Brotherhood took us prisoner They sold me to the innkeep They were gonna sell Arya to her mother at Riverrun along with another prisoner Big ugly fellow Foul mouth and a face like a half-burnt ham Not friendly
<name="podrick"> The Hound
<name="hot pie"> Thats the one If you find her, could you give her this? She liked the last one I gave her, but, well, this one turned out better
<name="brienne"> Um, you were saying?
<name="ings road brienne"> Her mothers dead, grandfathers dead, Walder Frey is the new lord of Riverrun The Brotherhood isnt going to Riverrun
<name="podrick"> Theyll take her to the Eyrie, my lady
<name="brienne"> Why the Eyrie?
<name="podrick"> Her aunt, Lysa Arryn Catelyn Starks sister Shes Aryas last living relative with money She hates the Lannisters Lord Tyrion made sure I knew which house married which and who hated who
<name="brienne"> Sansa could be there, too
<name="podrick"> Aye, my lady Could be
<name="brienne"> You sure about this?
<name="podrick"> No
<name="tyrion"> I imagined youd be back at the brothel at this hour
<name="oberyn"> I did spend some time with an absolutely stunning blonde the other day
<name="tyrion"> Mm, do tell Ive got every kind of filth down here except the kind I like
<name="oberyn"> Your sister
<name="tyrion"> Oh
<name="oberyn"> Cersei approached me We spoke a great deal about her daughter How worried your sister is about her She was trying very hard to pretend she had not come to sway me against you I think she may have even believed it herself
<name="tyrion"> Making honest feelings do dishonest work is one of her many gifts
<name="oberyn"> It was difficult for her to hide her true intentions It is rare to meet a Lannister who shares my enthusiasm for dead Lannisters She desperately wants to see you killed
<name="tyrion"> She didnt need to bother you It looks as though Ive taken care of that myself The joy she will feel when my head leaves my neck Shes wanted this for a long time
<name="oberyn"> Yes, I know We met, you and I Many years ago
<name="tyrion"> I think I would have remembered that
<name="oberyn"> Unlikely You had just been born Our father brought me and my sister Elia with him on a visit to Casterly Rock My first time away from Dorne I didnt like anything about the Rock Not the food, not the weather, your accents Nothing But the biggest disappointment you
<name="tyrion"> You and my family have more in common than you might admit
<name="oberyn"> The whole way from Dorne all anyone talked about was the monster that had been born to Tywin Lannister A head twice the size of his body, a tail between his legs, claws, one red eye, the privates of both a girl and a boy
<name="tyrion"> That would have made things so much easier
<name="oberyn"> When we met your sister, she promised she would show you to us Every day we would ask Every day she would say, Soon Then she and your brother took us to your nursery and she unveiled the freak Your head was a bit large Your arms and legs were a bit small, but no claw No red eye No tail between your legs Just a tiny pink cock We didnt try to hide our disappointment Thats not a monster, I told Cersei Thats just a baby And she said, He killed my mother And she pinched your little cock so hard, I thought she might pull it off Until your brother made her stop It doesnt matter, she told us Everyone says he will die soon I hope they are right He should not have lived this long
<name="tyrion"> Well sooner or later, Cersei always gets what she wants
<name="oberyn"> And what about what I want? Justice for my sister and her children
<name="tyrion"> If you want justice, youve come to the wrong place
<name="oberyn"> I disagree
<name="oberyn"> Ive come to the perfect place I want to bring those who have wronged me to justice And all those who have wronged me are right here I will begin with Ser Gregor Clegane, who killed my sisters children and then raped her with their blood still on his hands before killing her, too I will be your champion
<name="sansa"> Hello, Robin
<name="robin"> What are you doing?
<name="sansa"> Im building my home, Winterfell At least I think I am I havent been back there in a very long time
<name="robin"> Why did you leave?
<name="sansa"> Its a long story
<name="robin"> I stay here in the Eyrie Mother says its dangerous on the roads and I have to keep myself safe because Im the Lord of the Vale and the Lord of the Vale is a very important person
<name="sansa"> Yes, you certainly are
<name="robin"> When will you go back?
<name="sansa"> Probably never My family doesnt live there anymore and someone burned it down
<name="robin"> Oh Does Winterfell have a Moon Door?
<name="sansa"> No, Im afraid not Its not high up in the mountains Its down on the ground
<name="robin"> That sounds dangerous How do you make people fly?
<name="sansa"> We dont
<name="robin"> What do you do with all the bad people and the scary people and the people you dont like?
<name="sansa"> I never did anything with them at all Girls didnt take part in that where I came from
<name="robin"> Well, Im Lord of the Vale When I grow up, Ill be able to fly anybody who bothers me Or you When we get married, you can tell me if you dont like somebody and then we can bring them back here and, whoosh! Right through the Moon Door
<name="sansa"> I like the sound of that
<name="robin"> Lets put a Moon Door in your Winterfell
<name="sansa"> All right
<name="robin"> It can go in here in this big tower
<name="sansa"> Careful Youve ruined it Now Im going to have to rebuild the whole thing
<name="robin"> I didnt ruin it
<name="sansa"> You did
<name="robin"> It was already ruined because it didnt have a Moon Door I was fixing it
<name="sansa"> Knocking things down isnt fixing them Its ruining them
<name="robin"> I didnt ruin it
<name="sansa"> Youre being stupid
<name="robin"> I didnt ruin it
<name="sansa"> Robin, Im sorry, I-
<name="littlefinger"> Children
<name="sansa"> I hit him
<name="littlefinger"> Yes, I saw
<name="sansa"> I shouldnt have done that
<name="littlefinger"> No, his mother should have a long time ago Consider it a step in the right direction
<name="sansa"> If he tells Aunt Lysa.
<name="littlefinger"> Let me worry about Aunt Lysa
<name="sansa"> I was trying to remember what everything looked like Ill never see it again
<name="littlefinger"> A lot can happen between now and never If you want to build a better home, first you must demolish the old one
<name="sansa"> Why did you really kill Joffrey? Tell me why
<name="littlefinger"> I loved your mother more than you could ever know Given the opportunity, what do we do to those whove hurt the ones we love? In a better world, one where love could overcome strength and duty, you might have been my child But we dont live in that world
<name="littlefinger"> Youre more beautiful than she ever was
<name="sansa"> Lord Baelish.
<name="littlefinger"> Call me Petyr
<name="sansa"> You wanted to see me, Aunt Lysa?
<name="lysa"> Come here, Sansa
<name="lysa"> Do you know how far the fall is?
<name="sansa"> No
<name="lysa"> Neither do I, precisely Hundreds of feet Its fascinating what happens to bodies when they hit the rocks from such a height The impact breaks them right apart Like eggs dropped on the floor Sometimes pieces remain intact Youll find the head sitting on its own Every hair in place Blue eyes staring at nothing I know what you did
<name="sansa"> Im so sorry, Aunt Lysa I never should have hit Robin, I know it I promise it wont happen-
<name="lysa"> Dont be coy with me, you little whore You kissed him You kissed Petyr
<name="sansa"> I didnt You dont understand
<name="lysa"> I saw you! You cant lie to me because I saw it with my own eyes
<name="sansa"> He kissed me I pulled away
<name="lysa"> Liar! Whore! He is mine
<name="sansa"> Please
<name="lysa"> My father, my husband, my sister, they all stood between us and now theyre all dead Thats what happens to people who stand between Petyr and me Look down! Look down! Look down! Look down
<name="littlefinger"> Lysa! Let her go
<name="lysa"> You want her? This empty-headed child?
<name="littlefinger"> Let her go
<name="lysa"> Shes just like her mother Shell never love you I lied for you I killed for you Why did you bring her here? Why?
<name="littlefinger"> Ill send her away I swear on my life I swear to all the gods Let her go, Lysa
<name="littlefinger"> Oh, my sweet wife My sweet, silly wife

<name="jaime"> Youre a rare talent When youre fighting cripples, anyway
<name="bronn"> You learned to fight like a good little boy Ill bet that thrust through the MadKings back was pretty as a picture You want to fight pretty or you want to win?
<name="jaime"> You talk to my brother this way?
<name="bronn"> All the time He got used to it
<name="jaime"> Do you think he did it?
<name="bronn"> No Oh, he hated the little twat, sure But who didnt? And poisons not his style Or murder, for that matter You want to know for sure, why dont you ask him?
<name="bronn"> You havent been to see him yet, eh?
<name="jaime"> Were done for today
<name="bronn"> Your brother ever tell you how I came into his service?
<name="jaime"> You stood for him in his trial by combat at the Eyrie
<name="bronn"> Aye But only when Lady Arryn demanded the trial take place that day You were his first choice He named you for his champion because he knew you would ride day and night to come fight for him You gonna fight for him now?
<name="jaime"> To tell you the truth, this isnt so bad Four walls A pot to piss in I was chained to a wooden post covered in my own shit for months
<name="tyrion"> Is that supposed to make me feel better?
<name="jaime"> Maybe a bit Im sorry I didnt come sooner
<name="tyrion"> Its complicated, yes So how is our sister?
<name="jaime"> How do you think? Her son died in her arms
<name="tyrion"> Her son?
<name="jaime"> Dont You know whats coming?
<name="tyrion"> My trial for regicide.Yes, I know I know the whole bloody country thinks Im guilty I know that one of my three judges has wished me dead more times than I can count And that judge is my father As for Cersei, well, shes probably working on a way to avoid a trial altogether by having me killed
<name="jaime"> Now that you mention it, she did ask
<name="tyrion"> So, should I turn around and close my eyes?
<name="jaime"> Depends Did you do it?
<name="tyrion"> ingslayer brothers You like it? I like it Youre really asking if I killed your son?
<name="jaime"> Are you really asking if Id kill my brother? How can I help you?
<name="tyrion"> Well, you could set me free
<name="jaime"> You know I cant
<name="tyrion"> Then theres really nothing else to say
<name="jaime"> What do you want me to do? Kill the guards? Sneak you out of the city in the back of a cart? Im the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard
<name="tyrion"> Sorry, Id forgotten Id hate for you to do something inappropriate
<name="jaime"> Inappropriate? Youre accused of killing the king.Freeing you is treason
<name="tyrion"> Except I didnt do it
<name="jaime"> Which is why were having a trial A trial If the killer threw himself before the Iron Throne, confessed to his crimes, and gave irrefutable evidence of his guilt, it wouldnt matter to Cersei She wont rest until my heads on a spike
<name="jaime"> Not just yours Shes offering a knighthood to whomever finds Sansa Stark
<name="tyrion"> Sansa couldnt have done this She had more reason than anyone in the Seven Kingdoms Do you think its a coincidence she disappeared the same night Joffrey died?
<name="tyrion"> No, but Sansas not a killer Not yet, anyway
<name="sansa"> Where are you taking me?
<name="littlefinger"> Im getting married to your Aunt Lysa Shes waiting for us at the Eyrie Youll be safe there
<name="sansa"> Did you kill Joffrey?
<name="littlefinger"> Did I kill Joffrey? Ive been in the Vale for weeks
<name="sansa"> I know it was you
<name="littlefinger"> And who helped me with this conspiracy?
<name="sansa"> Well, there was Ser Dontos You used him to get me out of Kings Landing, but you would never trust him to kill the king
<name="littlefinger"> Why not?
<name="sansa"> Because youre too smart to trust a drunk
<name="littlefinger"> Then perhaps it was your husband
<name="sansa"> No
<name="littlefinger"> How do you know?
<name="sansa"> I just do
<name="littlefinger"> Youre right He wasnt involvedi n Joffreys death But you were Do you remember that lovely necklace Dontos gave you? I dont suppose you noticed that a stone was missing after the feast
<name="sansa"> The poison I dont understand The Lannisters gave you wealth, power Joffrey made you the Lord of Harrenhal
<name="littlefinger"> A man with no motive is a man no one suspects Always keep your foes confused If they dont know who you are or what you want, they cant know what you plan to do next
<name="sansa"> I dont believe you If they catch you, theyll put your head on a spike just like my fathers Youd risk that just to confuse them?
<name="littlefinger"> So many men they risk so little They spend their lives avoiding danger And then they die Id risk everything to get what I want
<name="sansa"> And what do you want?
<name="littlefinger"> Everything My friendship with the Lannisters was productive But Joffrey, a vicious boy with a crown on his head, is not a reliable ally And who could trust a friend like that?
<name="sansa"> Who could trust you?
<name="littlefinger"> I dont want friends like me My new friends are predictable Very reasonable people As for what happened to Joffrey, well, that was something my new friends wanted very badly Nothing like a thoughtful gift to make a new friendship grow strong
<name="margaery"> I cant believe youre going Leaving me alone here with these people
<name="olenna"> The time has come, my dear Theres nothing more tedious than a trial Except perhaps these gardens If I have to take one more leisurely stroll through these gardens, Ill fling myself from the cliffs
<name="olenna"> Have you been to see Tommen yet?
<name="margaery"> No Have they even agreed to the match? No one tells me anything
<name="olenna"> I wasnt originally meant to marry your grandfather Luthor, you know He was engaged to my sister, your great-aunt Viola I was to be given to some Targaryen or other Marrying a Targaryen was all the rage back then But the momentI saw my intended, with his twitchy little ferrets face and ludicrous silver hair, I knew he wouldnt do So the evening before Luthor was to propose to my sister, I got lost on my way back from my embroidery lesson and happened upon his chamber
<name="olenna"> How absentminded of me
<name="margaery"> Mm-hmm
<name="olenna"> The following morning, Luthor never made it down the stairs to propose to my sister cause the boy couldnt bloody walk
<name="olenna"> And once he could, the only thing he wanted was what Id given him the night before I was good I was very, very good You are even better But you need to act quickly Cersei may be vicious, but shes not stupid Shell turn the boy against you as soon as she can And by the time youre married, itll be too late Luckily for you ,the Queen Regent is rather distracted at the moment, mourning her dear departed boy Accusing her brother of his murder, which he didnt commit
<name="margaery"> Well, he could have done
<name="olenna"> He could have done,but he didnt
<name="margaery"> You dont know, Grandmother
<name="olenna"> But I do know You dont think Id let you marry that beast, do you?
<name="margaery"> What? I dont understand
<name="olenna"> Shh Dont you worry yourself about all that You just do what needs to be done
<name="jon"> Bring it through! And again
<name="jon"> Very nice Good
<name="jon"> A lot of wildlings fight with a weapon in each hand First thing you want to do is disarm them to try and even the odds
<name="jon"> Lets see what you can do
<name="jon"> Olly, you just watch for now
<name="olly"> I can fight
<name="jon"> Have you ever held a sword before I was the best archer in our hamlet
<name="olly"> I was
<name="grenn"> I believe you Well go hunting for rabbits one day Right now, watch and learn
<name="jon"> You two Take it slow, try and disarm each other
<name="jon"> You know how to fight You could have gone easier on him
<name="locke"> He wouldnt have learned anything that way
<name="alliser thorne"> Lord Snow What do you think youre doing?
<name="jon"> Grenn and I were helping them
<name="alliser thorn"> Grenns a ranger.Youre a steward Maybe you forgot that while you were off with your wildling bitch, but I didnt
<name="jon"> Someone has to train them
<name="alliser thorne"> And that someone isnt you Go find a chamber pot to empty Go on Do it You traitors bastard Give me an excuse Mormonts not hereto protect you now
<name="alliser thorne"> Get back to work Now! I said now
<name="janos slynt"> The bastards well-liked.Youre not
<name="alliser thorne"> You think I care if they like me? Were at war
<name="janos slynt"> For now But you cant be acting commander forever There will be a choosing The old maester will insist on it You might reconsider his request to marchon Crasters Let the mutineer stake care of Snow Or you might be taking orders from him the rest of your life
<name="locke"> A bastard, eh? Took you for highborn
<name="jon"> My father was highborn My mother wasnt
<name="locke"> Names Locke
<name="jon"> Jon Snow
<name="jon"> You fight well
<name="locke"> What brought you up here? A sense of duty I wanted to do my part for the safety of the realm I was a game warden in the Stormlands Fed a prized partridge to my hungry kids I was stupid enough to get caught Chose the Wall over losing my hand Figured I wouldnt have to suck up to any highborn cunts here
<name="alliser thorne"> Come on, get on with it What are you waiting for? Summer?
<name="locke"> Guess I was wrong
<name="jaime"> You sent for me, Your Grace?
<name="cersei"> Your Grace How formal of you How many Kingsguards are posted outside Tommens door?
<name="jaime"> Ser Boros is on duty tonight Tomorrow I believe.
<name="cersei"> So one? You have one man guarding the future king?
<name="jaime"> I promise you Tommens safe Were protecting him
<name="cersei"> The way you protected Joffrey? Why did Catelyn Stark set you free?
<name="jaime"> What?
<name="cersei"> Ive been wondering for months Ever since that great cow brought you back to the capital Why did she set you free?
<name="jaime"> You know why Shed hoped Id send her daughters back to her
<name="cersei"> She hoped or did you promise?
<name="jaime"> I swore by all the gods that if her daughters were alive, Id return them to her
<name="cersei"> So you made a sacred vow to the enemy
<name="jaime"> I wanted to get back to you Should I have told hert o fuck off?
<name="cersei"> You didnt mean it, then? You have no loyalty to Catelyn Stark?
<name="jaime"> Catelyn Starks dead So if I told you to leave the capital right now and find Sansa, if I told you to find that murderous little bitch and bring me her head, would you do it?
<name="cersei"> I know you went to see Tyrion That creature who murdered our son
<name="jaime"> I had to see him I had to know for myself
<name="cersei"> And?
<name="jaime"> He didnt do it, Cersei
<name="cersei"> Youve always pitied him Our poor little brother Abused by the world Despised by his father and sister Hed kill us all if he could I want four men at Tommens door day and night That will be all, Lord Commander
<name="tommen"> Ser Pounce?
<name="tommen"> How did you get past the Kingsguard?
<name="margaery"> Kingsguard
<name="tommen"> I dont think youre supposed to be here Mother doesnt allow me to have visitors at night
<name="margaery"> Im not a visitor, Your Grace Word has itIm to be your bride
<name="margaery"> Did you know that people in arranged marriages often never meet until their wedding day? Before we decide to spend our lives together, we ought to get to know one another Dont you think?
<name="tommen"> Yes But if my mother found out.
<name="margaery"> It can be our secret Hmm? If were going to be man and wife, well have a few secrets from her, I hope So, Your Grace.
<name="tommen"> Yes? Tell me a secret
<name="margaery"> Hello Arent you a proper fellow?
<name="tommen"> Thats Ser Pounce
<name="margaery"> Very handsome
<name="tommen"> Joffrey didnt like him He threatened to skin him alive and mix his innards up in my food so I wouldnt know I was eating him
<name="margaery"> Thats very cruel You dont strike me as cruel
<name="tommen"> No I dont think I am
<name="margaery"> Thats a relief Because you know what happens when we marry?
<name="tommen"> We say our vows in front of the High Septon And after the ceremony, theres a feast
<name="margaery"> When we marry, I become yours Forever Its getting late I should go May I come and visit you again? All right, then
<name="margaery"> Remember, our little secret
<name="brienne"> Ser Jaime Lannister Knighted and named to the Kingsguard in his 16th year At the sack of Kings Landing, murdered his king Aerys II Pardoned by Robert Baratheon Thereafter known as the Kingslayer
<name="jaime"> Its the duty of the Lord Commander to fill those pages And theres still room left on mine
<name="brienne"> Valyrian steel
<name="jaime"> Mmm Its yours
<name="brienne"> I cant accept this
<name="jaime"> It was reforged from Ned Starks sword Youll use it to defend Ned Starks daughter You swore an oath to return the Stark girls to their mother Lady Starks dead Aryas probably dead, too, but theres still a chance to find Sansa and get her somewhere safe Ive got something else for you
<name="jaime"> I hope I got your measurements right
<name="brienne"> Ill find her For Lady Catelyn And for you
<name="jaime"> I almost forgot I have one more gift
<name="brienne"> I dont need a squire
<name="jaime"> Of course you do
<name="brienne"> Hell slow me down
<name="jaime"> My brother owes him a debt Hes not safe here Youre keeping him from harm Its chivalry
<name="podrick"> I wont slow you down, ser my lady I promise Ill serve you well
<name="jaime"> See? Hes a good lad.Youll get along
<name="bronn"> Compliments of Lord Tyrion His axe from the Blackwater
<name="bronn"> What are you waiting for, a kiss? Ready the ladys horse
<name="jaime"> They say the best swords have names Any ideas?
<name="brienne"> Oathkeeper
<name="jaime"> Good-bye, Brienne
<name="podrick"> Come on, move
<name="sam"> I should neverhave taken her away
<name="jon"> She wasnt safe here
<name="sam"> Shes not safe out there I should have known You told us there were wildlings south of the Wall If theyre raiding the smaller villages, Moles Town could be next
<name="jon"> Castle Black could be next
<name="sam"> I should go back for Gilly
<name="jon"> We have orders No ones to leave the castle
<name="sam"> I remember when you disobeyed orders and rode south to help Robb
<name="jon"> And I remember who came after me and brought me home I know how hard it is, Sam, believe me When you told me about Bran going beyond the Wall, all I could think about was getting my strength back so I could go and find him
<name="sam"> I wish I could have convinced him to come back with me I tried Really, I did
<name="jon"> How fast could they travel? A crippled boy being pulled on a sledge by a simpleton?
<name="sam"> I dont know Theyd pass wildling villages They could try to find shelter at one of them
<name="jon"> The wildlings have joined up with Mance Every village or sheltered place will be deserted Except.
<name="sam"> Crasters? You think Bra nmight have found.
<name="locke"> Snow I dont mean to interrupt Thorne wants to see you
<name="alliser thorne"> Your foray to Crasters Keep, Ill sanction it But I wont order anyone to go with you Volunteers only
<name="jon"> Thank you, Ser Alliser
<name="jon"> Ahem, brothers
<name="jon"> Im going beyond the Wallto Crasters Keep Im going to capture the mutineers holed up there or kill them Im asking for volunteers to come with me Theres 60 miles of wilderness between here and Crasters and Mance Rayder has an army bearing down on us, but we have to do this Our survival may depend on us getting to these mutineers before Mance does They know the Wall They know our defenses If Mance learns what they know, were lost But if thats not enough, then consider this If the Nights Watch are truly brothers, then Lord Commander Mormont was our father He lived and died for the Watch and he was betrayed by his own men Stabbed in the back by cowards He deserved far better All we can give him now is justice Who will join me?
<name="jon"> I cant let a recruit come north of the Wall
<name="locke"> Then let me say my vows If its a fight youre heading for, then you need men who know how
<name="jon"> Thank you, brothers
<name="woman"> No, dont Dont, please

Season 4
EPISODE "THE CHILDREN" - 15/06/2014


<name="mance"> Youre wearing a black cloak again
<name="jon"> Ive been sent to negotiate with you
<name="mance"> It appears my trusting nature got the better of me Its happened before I was hoping your loyalty was real when you pledged yourself to us, Jon Snow, truly I was
<name="jon"> The Halfhand ordered me to join your army and bring back whatever information I could to Castle Black He made me kill him so youd trust me I was loyal, to him and to my Nights Watch vows
<name="mance"> All of your vows? She wasnt enough to turn ya, eh? Were you enough to turn her?
<name="jon"> She put three arrows in me when I escaped
<name="mance"> Did you see her again at Castle Black?
<name="jon"> Yes
<name="mance"> And?
<name="jon"> Shes dead
<name="mance"> Your doing?
<name="jon"> No
<name="mance"> Well drink to her
<name="mance"> Of all the ways Id kill you, poison would be the last
<name="mance"> Ygritte
<name="jon"> Ygritte
<name="jon"> Thats not wine
<name="mance"> No, its a proper Northern drink, Jon Snow You did well Fought hard Killed some of our strongest men One of our giants went into your tunnel and never came out again Mag the Mighty
<name="jon"> Hes dead He killed my friend Grenn
<name="mance"> He was their king Last of a bloodline that stretches back before the First Men
<name="jon"> Grenn came from a farm
<name="mance"> Mag and Grenn
<name="jon"> Grenn and Mag
<name="mance"> Kullback, could I trouble you for something to eat? I dont imagine our guest has eaten anything in quite some time So Youre here to strike a bargain?
<name="jon"> Turn your army around and go home
<name="mance"> You know I know youre low on arrows Youre low on oil Youre low on men How many are left? 50?
<name="jon"> I told Tormund and Orell We have more than a thousand men
<name="mance"> I showed you everything I had The whole army, a hundred thousand strong, and what did you do? You fired on us with everything you had It wasnt much Soon as I saw that I sent four hundred men to climb the wall An unmanned stretch five miles west of here A lot of them will die climbing, but most of them will be over by the end of the day This is me being honest with you, Jon Snow, which is more than youve ever done for me My people have bled enough Were not here to conquer, were here to hide behind your wall just like you We need your tunnel Now we both know that winter is coming and if my people arent south of the wall when it comes in earnest, well all end up worse than dead Wanna strike a bargain with me? Heres a bargain You go back, you open the gates to us and I swear to you that no one else will die Refuse and well kill every last man in Castle Black
<name="mance"> Ah! Oh, thats why youre here I reckon you could do it before any of them could stop ya Theyd kill you of course, theyd kill ya slow, but ya knew that when you came in here Are you capable of that, Jon Snow? Killing a man in his own tent when hes just offered ya peace? Is that what the Nights Watch is? Is that what you are?
<name="mance"> You attacking us?
<name="jon"> No, its like you said, we dont have the men
<name="mance"> Hold! To me To me
<name="mance"> Stand down! I said my people have bled enough and I meant it
<name="stannis"> Youre the king beyond the wall?
<name="stannis"> You know who I am?
<name="mance"> Never had the pleasure
<name="davos"> This is Stannis Baratheon, the one true king of the seven kingdoms
<name="mance"> Were not in the seven kingdoms and youre not dressed for this weather
<name="stannis"> It is customary to kneel when surrendering to a king
<name="mance"> We do not kneel
<name="stannis"> Ill have thousands of your men in chains by nightfall, Ill have nowhere to put them and nothing to feed them Im not here to slaughter beat dogs Their fate depends on their king
<name="mance"> All the same, we do not kneel
<name="stannis"> Take these men away
<name="davos"> What are men of the Nights Watch doing in a Wildling camp?
<name="jon"> I was sent to discuss terms with the king beyond the wall
<name="davos"> Youre speaking to the one true king boy Youll address him as your grace
<name="jon"> I know hes the king My father died for him My name is Jon Snow, your grace Im Ned Starks son
<name="stannis"> Your father was an honorable man
<name="jon"> He was, your grace
<name="stannis"> What do you think hed have done with him?
<name="jon"> I was this mans prisoner once He couldve tortured me, he couldve killed me, but he spared my life I think my father wouldve taken him prisoner, listened to what he had to say
<name="stannis"> Very well   Take him
<name="jon"> Your grace If my fatherd seen the things that Ive seen, hed also tell you to burn the dead before nightfall All of them
<name="pycelle"> I would suggest milk of the poppy to ease his pain but he is completely insensate
<name="cersei"> Bloody Martells
<name="pycelle"> The cause appears to be manticore venom
<name="qyburn"> It is, yes, manticore
<name="pycelle"> Ive read a good deal about it Its a horrible poison, usually Mantari in origin Oh! Yes, yes Theres nothing to be done
<name="qyburn"> Yes there is
<name="pycelle"> May I ask what you think youre doing?
<name="qyburn"> Saving him
<name="pycelle"> Your grace I wish it were otherwise, but Ser Gregor is beyond saving Well, well beyond This man is not even a Maester, let alone Grand Maester
<name="qyburn"> Thats for the best No Maester knows how to save him
<name="pycelle"> That is exactly the sort of arrogance that had him expelled from the citadel, your grace His curiosity was deemed dangerous and unnatural Rightly so in my opinion
<name="cersei"> Youre dismissed, Grand Maester
<name="pycelle"> Your grace This is my laboratory
<name="cersei"> Not anymore
<name="cersei"> You can save him?
<name="qyburn"> Difficult to say, your grace, but if my past work is any guide We stand a chance
<name="cersei"> Do everything you can Come to me with anything you need
<name="qyburn"> Thank you, your grace You should know, the process may change him, somewhat
<name="cersei"> Will it weaken him?
<name="qyburn"> Oh no
<name="cersei"> Very well then
<name="tywin"> Not another word Weve been over this, the matters closed
<name="cersei"> Im opening it again
<name="tywin"> You are betrothed to Loras Tyrell Still betrothed to Loras Tyrell and you will marry Loras Tyrell as soon as Tommen marries Margaery
<name="cersei"> I will not
<name="tywin"> Jaime cannot marry or inherit lands Tyrions sentence will be carried out tomorrow You have, on several occasions, made great claims about your commitment to this familys future Your role in that future is more vital now than it ever was
<name="cersei"> I dont care I will stay in Kings Landing where I belong with my son, the king
<name="tywin"> When you were nine years old, I was called to the capital I decided to take your brother with me and not you You insisted that you would not be left at Casterly Rock under any circumstances and if you recall
<name="cersei"> Im not interested in hearing another one of your smug stories about the time you won This isnt going to be one of those times
<name="tywin"> Do you think youll be the first person dragged into a sept to be married against her will?
<name="cersei"> When you marched into the throne room to tell me wed won the Battle at Blackwater, do you remember?! I was sitting on the iron throne with Tommen I was about to give him essence of nightshade, thats how far I was willing to go when I thought someone awful had come to take my son away Someone awful is coming to take him away
<name="tywin"> No
<name="cersei"> Joffrey is dead Myrcellas been sold like livestock And now you want to ship me off to Highgarden and steal my boy, my last boy Margaery will dig her claws in and you will dig your claws in and you will fight over him like beasts until you rip him apart I will burn our house to the ground before I let that happen
<name="tywin"> And how will you do that?
<name="cersei"> Ill tell everyone the truth
<name="tywin"> And what truth would that be?
<name="cersei"> You dont know, do you? You never believed it How is that possible? What am I saying, of course its possible How can someone so consumed by the idea of his family have any conception what his actual family was doing? We were right there in front of you and you didnt see us One look in the past twenty years, one real look and you wouldve known
<name="tywin"> Known what?
<name="cersei"> Everything they say is true About Jaime and me
<name="tywin"> No, no, no, no, no
<name="cersei"> Your legacy is a lie
<name="tywin"> I dont believe you
<name="cersei"> Yes you do
<name="cersei"> Jaime
<name="jaime"> You won One fewer brother Must be proud of yourself Theres really nothing you wouldnt do, is there?
<name="cersei"> For my family, no I would do things for my family you couldnt imagine
<name="jaime"> Tyrion is your family
<name="cersei"> Hes not
<name="jaime"> You dont get to choose
<name="cersei"> I do, so do you You can choose the creature that killed our mother to come into this world
<name="jaime"> Are you really mad enough to blame him for that? He didnt decide to kill her He was an infant
<name="cersei"> A disease doesnt decide to kill you, all the same you cut it out before it does What do you decide? What do you choose?
<name="jaime"> The things I did to get back to you, to endure all that, only to find you
<name="cersei"> I choose you
<name="jaime"> Those are words
<name="cersei"> Yes Like the ones I just said to father I told him
<name="jaime"> Told him what?
<name="cersei"> I told him about us
<name="jaime"> You told him?
<name="cersei"> I told him I wouldnt marry Loras Tyrell I told him Im staying right here with Tommen, with you
<name="jaime"> You think hell just accept that?
<name="cersei"> Go and ask him
<name="jaime"> What did you say?
<name="cersei"> I dont want to talk about Tywin Lannister I dont choose Tywin Lannister, I dont love Tywin Lannister I love my brother I love my lover People will whisper, theyll make their jokes Let them Theyre all so small I cant even see them I only see what matters
<name="jaime"> Someone will walk in
<name="cersei"> I dont care
<name="mereen missandei">   You stand before Daenerys Stormborn, the Unburnt, Queen of Mereen, Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons
<name="fennesz">   Thank you for seeing me, your grace My name is Fennesz I can speak the common tongue if you wish
<name="daenerys"> You speak it very well
<name="fennesz"> Before you freed me, I belonged to Master Mighdal I was tutor to his children I taught them languages and history They know a great deal about your family because of me Little Calla is only seven, but she admires you very much
<name="daenerys"> I hope I can prove worthy of her admiration What can I do for you?
<name="fennesz"> When you took the city, the children begged me not to leave the house But Master Mighdal and I agreed that I must So I lost my home Now I live on the streets
<name="daenerys"> I have outfitted mess halls to feed all former slaves and barracks to shelter them
<name="fennesz"> I do not mean to offend, your grace I went to one of these places The young prey on the old Take what they want and beat us if we resist
<name="daenerys"> My Unsullied will make them safe again in short order my friend, this I promise you
<name="fennesz"> Even if they are safe, who would I be there? What purpose would I serve? With my master, I was a teacher I had the respect and love of these children
<name="daenerys"> What is it that you want from me?
<name="fennesz"> Your grace, I ask you to let me sell myself back to Master Mighdal
<name="daenerys"> You want to return to a man who owned you, like a goat or a chair?
<name="fennesz"> Please, your grace, the young may rejoice in the new world youve built for them But for those of us too old to change there is only fear and squalor I am not alone There are many outside waiting to beg the same
<name="daenerys"> I did not take this city to preside over the injustice I fought to destroy I took it to bring people freedom But freedom means making your own choices I will allow you to sign a contract with your former master It may not cover a period lasting longer than a year
<name="fennesz"> Thank you, your grace Thank you
<name="barristan"> The masters will take advantage of this situation The men serving them will be slaves in all but name

Season 4
EPISODE "THE LAWS OF GODS AND MEN" - 11/05/2014


<name="davos"> Your Grace, if youd like to sit, Im sure that-
<name="stannis"> Weve been here since midday
<name="davos"> Easterners have a difference sense of time, Ive often found Once I was waiting for Salladhor Saan here in Braavos Together, we were going to run three shiploads of the finest-
<name="tycho"> Welcome to the Iron Bank Please, sit
<name="tycho"> What can we do for you, Lord Stannis?
<name="davos"> This is Stannis of the House Baratheon, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm
<name="tycho"> The Iron Throne is currently occupied by Tommen of the House Baratheon, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm
<name="stannis"> He shares no blood with me He is a bastard born of incest As was his brother before him
<name="tycho"> Yes, we have heard this story
<name="stannis"> Its not a story Its the truth
<name="tycho"> The kings grandfather tells a different story A story about a jealous uncle whose attempts to usurp the throne from the rightful king cost the Seven Kingdoms dearly in blood and gold
<name="stannis"> Gold you loaned him
<name="tycho"> And you feel your blood gives you a claim on our gold?
<name="stannis"> More than any man living
<name="tycho"> Across the Narrow Sea, your books are filled with words like usurper and madman and blood right Here, our books are filled with numbers We prefer the stories they tell More plain Less open to interpretation How many fighting men remain loyal to you?
<name="stannis"> 4,000
<name="tycho"> And how many ships do you have? The ones still afloat, Ser Davos, not at the bottom of Blackwater Bay
<name="davos"> 32
<name="tycho"> And how much wheat and barley and beef and pork do you produce on Dragonstone to feed your 4,000 men on your 32 ships?
<name="stannis"> None
<name="tycho"> You can see why these numbers seem unlikely to add up to a happy ending from our perspective Im afraid we must respectfully decline your request But we thank you for paying us the honor of your visit
<name="davos"> My lord
<name="tycho"> Im not a lord, Ser Davos Seaworth You would not be either here In Braavos, thieves are not rewarded with titles
<name="davos"> Well, strictly speaking, I didnt do the thieving That would be the pirates I just moved what they stole from one place to another {DAVOS removes his right glove to show the stubs of his fingers
<name="davos"> This is the payment that was demanded by King Stannis for my crimes I consider it an honest accounting Hes an honest man and hes your best chance to get back the money youve sunk into Westeros Which is a lot, I imagine Wars are expensive
<name="tycho"> The war is over
<name="davos"> As long as Stannis lives, the war is not over Whos the real power in Kings Landing?
<name="tycho"> Ser Davos.
<name="davos"> Humor me
<name="tycho"> Tywin Lannister
<name="dav os"> How old is Tywin Lannister?
<name="tycho"> 67
<name="stannis"> 67 And when he dies, whos in command? A half-grown boy, the product of incest? Cersei Lannister, a queen whose people despise her? Jaime Lannister, a man best known for killing the king he was sworn to protect? When Tywins gone, who do you back?
<name="tycho"> That is a problem for another time
<name="davos"> Begging your pardon, I think its a problem for now Theres only one reliable leader left in Westeros Stannis Hes got the birthright Hes in his prime Hes a tried and tested battle commander And he doesnt just talk about paying people back, he does it
<name="sallador"> The lookout sees a pirate ship sailing their way The captain shouts to his first mate, Bring me my red shirt The first mate brings the red shirt and the captain puts it on And when the pirates try to board, the brave captain leads his men to victory A few days later, the lookout screams, Two pirate ships! The crew is shivering like scared mice But the courageous captain hollers, Bring me my red shirt!
<name="sallador"> After the battle, the first mate asks, Captain, why do you call for your red shirt before battle? The captain replies, So that if I am stabbed, you will not see me bleed The next morning the lookout screams, 10 pirate ships! We are surrounded! The crew goes silent
<name="sallador"> They all look to their brave captain, waiting for his usual command Calm as ever, the captain bellows.
<name="women"> Bring me my brown pants!
<name="davos"> You think they ever met a pirate who didnt tell them that joke?
<name="sallador"> Davos I heard you were rotting in a dungeon in Dragonstone
<name="davos"> Only half rotted
<name="sallador"> Join us, my friend Join us This is Lhara And this is-
<name="lhara"> I am Lhara
<name="sallador"> Shes an artist, this one, truly
<name="davos"> No time, Im afraid We sail at sunrise
<name="sallador"> We?
<name="davos"> You, me we
<name="sallador"> Once I thought this man loved me Now I know he despises me He wants to see me die poor and alone on some cold-
<name="davos"> You wont be alone And you wont be poor
<name="davos"> Theres a chest of the good stuff left back at your house I gave it to your wife
<name="sallador"> Youre not my friend, my friend
<name="davos"> Ill see you at sunrise
<name="yara"> I give you until the full moon to order all ironborn scum out of the North and back to those shit-stained rocks you call home On the first night of the full moon, I will hunt down every islander still on our lands and flay them living, the way I flayed the 20 ironborn scum I found at Winterfell In the box youll find a special gift Theons favorite toy He cried when I took it away from him Leave the North now or more boxes will follow with more Theon Signed Ramsay Snow, natural born son of Roose Bolton, Lord of the Dreadfort and Warden of the North

<name="missandei"> The Queen says you may approach and speak
<name="missandei"> He is a goatherd He says he prayed for your victory against the slave masters
<name="daenerys"> I thank him for his prayers
<name="missandei"> It was your dragons, he says They came this morning for his flock
<name="missandei"> He hopes he has not offended Your Grace, but now he has nothing
<name="daenerys"> Tell this man I am sorry for his hardship I cannot bring back his goats
<name="daenerys"> but I will see he is paid their value three times over
<name="daenerys"> Send the next one in
<name="manservant"> The noble Hizdahr zo Loraq begs an audience with the Queen
<name="daenerys"> The noble Hizdahr zo Loraq can speak to me himself
<name="hizdahr"> Queen Daenerys Tales of your beauty were not exaggerated
<name="daenerys"> I thank you
<name="hizdahr"> Mine is one of the oldest and proudest families in Meereen
<name="daenerys"> Then it is my honor to receive you
<name="hizdahr"> My father, one of Meereens most respected and beloved citizens, oversaw the restoration and maintenance of its greatest landmarks This pyramid included
<name="daenerys"> For that, he has my gratitude I should be honored to meet him
<name="hizdahr"> You have, Your Grace You crucified him I pray youll never live to see a member of your family treated so cruelly
<name="daenerys"> Your father crucified innocent children
<name="hizdahr"> My father spoke out against crucifying those children He decried it as a criminal act, but was overruled Is it justice to answer one crime with another?
<name="daenerys"> I am sorry you no longer have a father, but my treatment of the masters was no crime Youd be wise to remember that
<name="hizdahr"> Whats done is done You are the queen and I am a servant of Meereen A servant who does not wish to see its traditions eradicated
<name="daenerys"> And what traditions do you speak of?
<name="hizdahr"> The tradition of funeral rite Proper burial in the Temple of the Graces My father and 162 noble Meereenese are still nailed to those posts, carrion for vultures, rotting in the sun
<name="hizdahr"> Your Grace, I ask that you order these men taken down so that they might receive proper burials
<name="daenerys"> And what of the slave children these noble Meereenese crucified? They were rotting in the sun as well Would you have begged me for their right to a proper burial?
<name="hizdahr"> Your Grace, I cannot defend the actions of the masters I can only speak to you as a son who loved his father Let me take his body down Let me have him brought to the temple and buried with dignity so that he might find peace in the next world
<name="daenerys"> Bury your father, Hizdahr zo Loraq
<name="hizdahr"> Thank you, my queen

<name="daenerys"> 212?
<name="daenerys"> Send the next one in
<name="oberyn"> These meetings arent always going to be this early, are they? I was up late last night So, does this mean I am a master of something now? Coins, ships?
<name="mace"> Lord Tywin and I already determined that I shall be the Master of Ships long before you-
<name="mace"> Lord Tywin, its a great honor to have been granted a seat on this council I-
<name="tywin"> The trial begins this afternoon We only have the morning for affairs of state Shall we begin?
<name="varys"> Sandor Clegane has been spotted in the Riverlands, my lord
<name="cersei"> A coward and a traitor
<name="varys"> My birds tell me the Hound slaughtered five of our soldiers I believe the phrase fuck the king was uttered
<name="pycelle"> Disgraceful
<name="tywin"> What would it take to make the common soldier stupid enough to try his luck with the Hound?
<name="varys"> 10 silver stags seems a generous bounty
<name="tywin"> Make it 100 What else?
<name="varys"> More whispers from the east, my lord
<name="tywin"> The Targaryen girl?
<name="varys"> Daenerys has taken up residence in Meereen She has conquered the city and rules as its queen
<name="cersei"> Conquered with what?
<name="varys"> She commands an army of Unsullied, my queen Some 8,000 strong She has a company of sellswords the Second Sons She has two knights advising her Jorah Mormont and Barristan Selmy And she has three dragons
<name="cersei"> Baby dragons Larger every year, Your Grace
<name="pycelle"> Mormont is spying on her for us
<name="varys"> No longer He appears to be fully devoted to her As for Ser Barristan, it would seem he took his dismissal from the Kingsguard a bit harder than anticipated
<name="cersei"> Hes an old man He wasnt fit to protect my son
<name="tywin"> Joffrey didnt die on his watch Dismissing him was as insulting as it was stupid
<name="cersei"> Dont tell me youre worried about a child halfway across the world
<name="varys"> A child with two seasoned warriors counseling her and a powerful army at her back, Your Grace
<name="oberyn"> Lord Varys is right I have been to Essos and seen the Unsullied firsthand They are very impressive on the battlefield Less so in the bedroom
<name="tywin"> Dragons havent won a war in 300 years Armies win them all the time She must be dealt with
<name="pycelle"> How, my lord? By force?
<name="tywin"> Eventually, if it comes to that Can your little birds find their way into Meereen?
<name="varys"> Most certainly, my Lord Hand
<name="tywin"> Mmm Lord Tyrell, be a good man Fetch my quill and paper
<name="varys"> Prince Oberyn
<name="oberyn"> Lord Varys.
<name="varys"> Only Varys Im not actually a nobleman No one is under obligation to call me lord
<name="oberyn"> And yet everyone does
<name="varys"> You seem quite knowledgeable about the Unsullied Did you spend much time in Essos?
<name="oberyn"> Five years
<name="varys"> May I ask why?
<name="oberyn"> Tis a big and beautiful world Most of us live and die in the same corner where we were born and never get to see any of it I dont want to be most of us
<name="varys"> Most of us arent princes
<name="oberyn"> You are from Essos Where? Lys?
<name="varys"> I have an ear for accents Ive lost my accent entirely
<name="oberyn"> I have an ear for that as well How did you get here?
<name="varys"> Its a long story
<name="oberyn"> One you dont like telling people
<name="varys"> People I trust
<name="oberyn"> My paramour Ellaria, she would find you very interesting You should come to the brothel and meet her We brought our own wine, not the swill they serve here We have some lovely boys on retainer, but.
<name="oberyn"> You did like boys before?
<name="oberyn"> Really? Girls? Hmm I hope you wont be offended when I say I never would have guessed
<name="varys"> Not at all But I was never interested in girls, either
<name="oberyn"> What then?
<name="varys"> Nothing
<name="oberyn"> Everybody is interested in something
<name="varys"> Not me When I see what desire does to people, what its done to this country, I am very glad to have no part in it Besides, the absence of desire leaves one free to pursue other things
<name="oberyn"> Such as?
<name="tyrion"> Let me guess, Ive been pardoned
<name="tyrion"> Really?
<name="jaime"> Fathers orders
<name="tyrion"> Well, we mustnt disappoint Father , the Iron Throne room
<name="man"> Kingslayer
<name="tommen"> I, Tommen of the House Baratheon, First of my Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, do hereby recuse myself from this trial Tywin of the House Lannister, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm, will sit as judge in my stead And with him Prince Oberyn of the House Martell and Lord Mace of the House Tyrell And if found guilty may the gods punish the accused
<name="tywin"> Tyrion of the House Lannister, you stand accused by the Queen Regent of regicide Did you kill King Joffrey?
<name="tyrion"> No
<name="tywin"> Did your wife, the Lady Sansa?
<name="tyrion"> Not that I know of
<name="tywin"> How would you say he died, then?
<name="tyrion"> Choked on his pigeon pie
<name="tywin"> So you would blame the bakers?
<name="tyrion"> Or the pigeons Just leave me out of it
<name="twyin"> The crown may call its first witness
<name="meryn trant"> Once wed got King Joffrey safely away from the mob, the Imp rounded on him He slapped the king across the face and called him a vicious idiot and a fool It wasnt the first time the Imp threatened Joffrey Right here in this throne room, he marched up those steps and called our king a halfwit Compared His Grace to the Mad King and suggested hed meet the same fate And when I spoke in the kings defense, he threatened to have me killed
<name="tyrion"> Oh, why dont you tell them what Joffrey was doing?
<name="tywin"> Silence
<name="tyrion"> Pointing a loaded crossbow at Sansa Stark while you tore at her clothes and beat her
<name="tywin"> Silence! You will not speak unless called upon Youre dismissed
<name="pycelle"> Basilisk venom, widows blood, wolfsbane, essence of nightshade, sweetsleep, tears of Lys, demons dance blind eye-
<name="oberyn"> I think you have made your point, Grand Maester You have a lot of poison in your store
<name="pycelle"> Had, Prince Oberyn My stores were plundered
<name="tywin"> By whom?
<name="pycelle"> By the accused, Tyrion Lannister, after he had me wrongfully imprisoned
<name="tywin"> Grand Maester, you examined King Joffreys corpse Was it without question poison that killed him?
<name="pycelle"> Without question
<name="pycelle"> This was found on the body of Dontos Hollard, the kings fool He was last seen spiriting Sansa Stark, the wife of the accused, away from the feast She wore this necklace the day of the wedding Residue of a most rare and terrible poison was found inside
<name="tywin"> Was this one of the poisons stolen from your store?
<name="pyelle"> It was The Strangler A poison few in the Seven Kingdoms possess And used to strike down the most noble child the gods ever put on this good earth
<name="cersei"> I will hurt you for this A day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth and you will know the debt is paid
<name="mace"> Your own brother said this to you?
<name="cersei"> Shortly before the Battle of Blackwater Bay I confronted him about his plans to put Joffrey on the front lines As it turned out, when the attack came, Joff insisted on remaining at the battlements He believed his presence would inspire the troops
<name="oberyn"> Tyrion said, And you will know the debt is paid What debt?
<name="cersei"> I discovered hed been keeping whores in the Tower of the Hand I asked him to confine his salacious acts to the brothel where such behavior belongs He wasnt pleased
<name="tywin"> Thank you, Your Grace, for the courage of your testimony
<name="mace"> Do you remember the precise nature of this threat?
<name="varys"> Im afraid I do, my lord He said, Perhaps you should speak more softly to me, then Monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies
<name="mace"> And he said this to you at a meeting of the small council?
<name="varys"> Yes After we received word of Robb Starks death He didnt seem gladdened by the news Perhaps his marriage to Sansa Stark had made him more sympathetic to the northern cause
<name="twyin"> Youre excused, Lord Varys
<name="tyrion"> Father, may I ask the witness one question?
<name="tywin"> One
<name="tyrion"> You once said that without me, this city would have faced certain defeat You said the histories would never mention me, but you would not forget Have you forgotten, Lord Varys?
<name="varys"> Sadly, my lord, I never forget a thing
<name="tywin"> We will adjourn for now
<name="tywin"> Toll the bells in an hours time
<name="guard"> Clear the court
<name="jaime"> Youd condemn your own son to death?
<name="tywin"> Ive condemned no one The trial is not over
<name="jaime"> This isnt a trial Its a farce Cersei has manipulated everything and you know it
<name="tywin"> I know nothing of the sort
<name="jaime"> Youve always hated Tyrion
<name="tywin"> He killed his king
<name="jaime"> As did I Do you know the last order the Mad King gave me? To bring him your head I saved your life so you could murder my brother?
<name="tywin"> It wont be murder Itll be justice
<name="jaime"> Justice?
<name="tywin"> Im performing my sworn duty as Hand of the King If Tyrion is found guilty, he will be punished accordingly
<name="jaime"> Hell be executed
<name="tywin"> No, hell be punished accordingly
<name="jaime"> Once you said family is what lives on All that lives on You told me about a dynasty that would last 1,000 years What happens to your dynasty when Tyrion dies? Im a Kingsguard, forbidden by oath to carry on the family line
<name="tywin"> Im well aware of your oath
<name="jaime"> What happens to your name? Who carries the lion banner into future battles? Your nephews? Lancel Lannister? Others whose names I dont even remember?
<name="tywin"> What happens to my dynasty if I spare the life of my grandsons killer?
<name="jaime"> It survives through me Ill leave the Kingsguard Ill take my place as your son and heir if you let Tyrion live
<name="tywin"> Done
<name="tywin"> When the testimonys concluded and a guilty verdict rendered, Tyrion will be given the chance to speak Hell plead for mercy Ill allow him to join the Nights Watch In three days time, hell depart for Castle Black and live out his days at the Wall Youll remove your white cloak immediately You will leave Kings Landing to assume your rightful place at Casterly Rock You will marry a suitable woman and father children named Lannister And youll never turn your back on your family again
<name="jaime"> You have my word
<name="tywin"> And you have mine -
<name="tyrion"> Not going well, is it?
<name="jaime"> Youre going to be found guilty
<name="tyrion"> Oh, you think so?
<name="jaime"> When you are, you need to enter a formal plea for mercy and ask to be sent to the Wall Fathers agreed to it Hell spare your life and allow you to join the Nights Watch
<name="tyriom"> Ned Stark was promised the same thing and we both know how that turned out
<name="jaime"> Father is not Joffrey Hell keep his word
<name="tyrion"> How do you know?
<name="jaime"> Do you trust me?
<name="jaime"> Keep your mouth shut No more outbursts This will all be over soon
<name="tywin"> The crown may call its next witness
<name="tywin"> State your name
<name="shae"> Shae
<name="tywin"> Do you swear by all the gods that your testimony will be true and honest?
<name="shae"> I swear it
<name="tywin"> Do you know this man?
<name="shae"> Yes Tyrion Lannister
<name="tywin"> How do you know him?
<name="shae"> I was handmaiden to his wife Lady Sansa
<name="tywin"> This man stands accused of murdering King Joffrey What do you know of this?
<name="shae"> I know that hes guilty
<name="shae"> He and Sansa planned it together
<name="tywin"> Silence! Continue
<name="shae"> She wanted revenge for her father, her mother, her brother She blamed their deaths on the king Tyrion was happy to help He hated Joffrey He hated the queen He hated you, my lord
<name="shae"> He stole poison from the Grand Maesters chamber to put in Joffreys wine
<name="oberyn"> How could you possibly know all this? Why would he reveal such plans to his wifes maid?
<name="shae"> I wasnt just her maid I was his whore
<name="mace"> I beg your pardon? You said you were his.
<name="shae"> His whore
<name="tywin"> How did you come to be in his service?
<name="shae"> He stole me I was with another man, a knight in your lordships army But when Tyrion arrived at the camp, he sent one of his cutthroats into our tent He broke the knights arm and brought me to Lord Tyrion You belong to me now, he said I want you to fuck me like its my last night in this world
<name="tywin"> Silence Silence
<name="oberyn"> And did you?
<name="shae"> Did I what?
<name="oberyn"> Fuck him like it was his last night in this world
<name="shae"> I did everything he wanted Whatever he told me to do to him Whatever he felt like doing to me I kissed him where he wanted I licked him where he wanted I let him put himself where he wanted I was his property I would wait in his chambers for hours so he could use me when he was bored He ordered me to call him my lion, so I did I took his face in my hands and said, I am yours and you are mine
<name="tyrion"> Shae Please dont
<name="shae"> I am a whore Remember? That was before he married Sansa After that, all he wanted was her But she wouldnt let him into her bed So he promised to kill King Joffrey for her
<name="tyrion"> Father, I wish to confess I wish to confess
<name="tywin"> You wish to confess?
<name="tyrion"> I saved you I saved this city and all your worthless lives I should have let Stannis kill you all
<name="tywin"> Tyrion Do you wish to confess?
<name="tyrion"> Yes, Father Im guilty Guilty Is that what you want to hear?
<name="tywin"> You admit you poisoned the king?
<name="tyrion"> No, of that Im innocent Im guilty of a far more monstrous crime I am guilty of being a dwarf
<name="tywin"> You are not on trial for being a dwarf
<name="tyrion"> Oh, yes, I am Ive been on trial for that my entire life
<name="tywin"> Have you nothing to say in your defense?
<name="tyrion"> Nothing but this I did not do it I did not kill Joffrey, but I wish that I had
<name="tyrion"> Watching your vicious bastard die gave me more relief than 1,000 lying whores
<name="tyrion"> I wish I was the monster you think I am I wish I had enough poison for the whole pack of you I would gladly give my life to watch you all swallow it
<name="tywin"> Escort the prisoner back to his cell

<name="selyse"> You barely know her You think shes sweet because she smiles when you visit Shes sullen and stubborn and sinful Why else would the Lord of Light have seen fit to mark her face? She needs the rod
<name="stannis"> Shes my daughter You will not strike her
<name="selyse"> As you command Perhaps the Lady Melisandre could speak with her
<name="shireen"> Come in
<name="melisandre"> Were you sleeping, Princess?
<name="melisandre"> Did you watch the ceremony on the beach?
<name="shireen"> I heard it
<name="melisandre"> And it frightened you?
<name="shireen"> Ser Axell was my uncle He was always kind to me
<name="melisandre"> Theyre in a better place now, Princess The fire cleansed them of the sins of the world
<name="shireen"> But they screamed
<name="melisandre"> Women scream when they give birth Afterward they are filled with joy
<name="shireen"> Afterward they arent ash and bone
<name="melisandre"> You have so many questions, dont you? So did I when I was a child I was much like you Only I wasnt a princess
<name="shireen"> And you didnt have this
<name="melisandre"> No But I suffered in other ways, sweet girl, believe me What do you know of the gods?
<name="shireen"> I read
<name="melisandre"> Lies and fables Septons speak of seven gods There are but two a god of light and love and joy and a god of darkness, evil, and fear Eternally at war
<name="shireen"> There are no seven heavens and no seven hells?
<name="melisandre"> Theres only one hell, Princess The one we live in now
<name="hodor"> Hodor
<name="bran"> Why did you wake me?
<name="meera"> Youve been gone for hours
<name="bran"> I was hungry
<name="meera"> Were all hungry
<name="bran"> I was just eating
<name="jojen"> Summer was eating Your body cant live on the food your wolf consumes Spending too much time in Summers skin is dangerous Youre not a direwolf, Bran
<name="jojen"> Must be glorious, though To run, to leap, to hunt To be whole I know thats tempting, but if youre trapped in Summer for too long, youll forget what it was to be human
<name="meera"> Youd forget us, Bran Youd forget your mother and father Youd forget your brothers and sisters Youd forget Winterfell Youd forget you And if we lose you, we lose everything
<name="bran"> Hodor, take me to the tree THREE
<name="eyed raven"> Look for me beneath the tree
<name="cersei"> He saw us THREE
<name="eyed raven"> North
<name="bran"> I know where we have to go
<name="high septon"> Let it be known that Margaery of House Tyrell and Joffrey of the Houses Lannister and Baratheon are one heart, one flesh, one soul Cursed be he who would seek to tear them asunder
<name="joffrey"> With this kiss, I pledge my love
<name="sansa"> We have a new queen
<name="tyrion"> Better her than you
<name="tywin"> Bit much, wouldnt you say?
<name="olenna"> It feels proportionate
<name="tywin"> Proportionate to what?
<name="olenna"> The expected extravagance
<name="tywin"> People who spend their money on this sort of nonsense tend not to have it for long
<name="olenna"> You ought to try enjoying something before you die You might find it suits you
<name="olenna"> Not now, Mace Lord Tywin and I are speaking
<name="olenna"> Anyway, I dont know what youre complaining about Im paying my share
<name="tywin"> Shall we stick golden roses in half the meat pies to commemorate your generosity?
<name="olenna"> No, your heartfelt thank-you is its own reward I would imagine Id be hearing it again before long Wars are rather expensive The Iron Bank will have its due How they love to remind everyone Almost as much as you Lannisters with your debts
<name="tywin"> Im not worried about the Iron Bank
<name="olenna"> We both know youre smarter than that Come, Tywin, let us celebrate young love
<name="bronn"> All taken care of
<name="tyrion"> You saw her board the ship?
<name="bronn"> Aye, shes on it
<name="tyrion"> You saw the ship sail away?
<name="bronn"> No one knows shes there but you, me, and Varys
<name="tyrion"> How do you know?
<name="bronn"> Because if someone follows me without an invitation, Im the last person they ever follow
<name="tyrion"> Theres someone following you?
<name="bronn"> Shes gone I know you dont want to believe it, but she is Now, go drink till it feels like you did the right thing
<name="oberyn"> Hello
<name="tyrion"> Hello
<name="oberyn"> Not you
<name="olenna"> You look exquisite, child The wind has been at you, though I havent had the opportunity to tell you how sorry I was to hear about your brother War is war, but killing a man at a wedding, horrid What sort of monster would do such a thing? As if men need more reasons to fear marriage
<name="tyrion"> My lady My lady
<name="olenna"> Lord Tyrion, you see? Not as bad as all that Perhaps if your pauper husband were to sell his mule and his last pair of shoes, he might be able to afford to bring you to Highgarden for a visit Now that peace has come and all is right with the world, it would do you good to see some of it You must excuse me Its time I ate some of this food I paid for
<name="musician"> A coat of gold / Or a coat of red / A lion still has claws And mine, my lord.
<name="joffrey"> Very good Very good Off you go MARGAERY; My love, why dont we make the announcement?
<name="joffrey"> Everyone The queen would like to say a few words
<name="margaery"> We are so fortunate to enjoy this marvelous food and drink Not all among us are so lucky To thank the gods for bringing the recent war to a just end, King Joffrey has decreed that the leftovers from our feast be given to the poorest in his city
<name="cersei"> Youre an example to us all
<name="loras"> Ser Jaime, Im very sorry
<name="jaime"> Ser Loras, its quite all right Your sister looks very beautiful
<name="loras"> As does yours
<name="jaime"> So, looking forward to your wedding?
<name="loras"> Yes, very much
<name="jaime"> Our fathers are both rather keen on the prospect
<name="loras"> They certainly are
<name="jaime"> Perhaps they should get married If you were to marry Cersei, shed murder you in your sleep If you somehow managed to put a child in her first, shed murder him, too, long before he drew his first breath Luckily for you, none of this will happen because youll never marry her
<name="loras"> And neither will you
<name="brienne"> Your Grace My king My queen
<name="margaery"> Lady Brienne So good of you to come
<name="brienne"> Im no lady, Your Grace
<name="cersei"> Did you just bow?
<name="brienne"> Apologies, Your Grace I never did master the curtsy
<name="joffrey"> Youre the one who put a sword through Renly Baratheon
<name="margaery"> Thats not true, my love Brienne had nothing to do with it
<name="joffrey"> A shame Id knight the man that put an end to that deviants life
<name="brienne"> I just wanted to congratulate you both and wish you good fortune The country has been at war too long I hope your reign is long and peaceful
<name="joffrey"> Yes, yes
<name="margaery"> Thank you I hope we see more of you
<name="cersei"> Lady Brienne Youre Lord Selwyn Tarths daughter That makes you a lady whether you want to be or not
<name="brienne"> As you say, Your Grace
<name="cersei"> I owe you my gratitude You returned my brother safely to Kings Landing
<name="brienne"> In truth, he rescued me, Your Grace More than once
<name="cersei"> Did he? Havent heard that story before
<name="brienne"> Not such a fascinating story, Im afraid
<name="cersei"> Im sure you have many fascinating stories Sworn to Renly Baratheon Sworn to Catelyn Stark And now my brother Must be exciting to flit from one camp to the next serving whichever lord or lady you fancy
<name="brienne"> I dont serve your brother, Your Grace
<name="cersei"> But you love him
<name="brienne"> Your Grace
<name="pycelle"> No, no, come to my chambers and I will examine you personally
<name="cersei"> Shell do no such thing
<name="pycelle"> Oh, Your Grace Yes, well, this young lady sought my advice.
<name="cersei"> You should see Qyburn Hes quite good
<name="maid"> Your Grace
<name="pycelle"> Qyburn? Deplorable man Brought shame on the Citadel with his repugnant experiments
<name="cersei"> More repugnant than your gnarled fingers on that girls thighs?
<name="pycelle"> Your Grace, I am a man of learning
<name="cersei"> My little brother had you sent to the Black Cells when you annoyed him What do you think I could do to you if you annoyed me?
<name="pycelle"> I never meant to annoy anyone
<name="cersei"> But you are You annoy me right now Every breath you draw in my presence annoys me So heres what I want you to do I want you to leave my presence Leave this wedding right now Go to the kitchens and instruct them that all the leftovers from the feast will be brought to the kennels
<name="pycelle"> Your Grace, Queen Margaery.
<name="cersei"> The queen is telling you the leftovers will feed the dogs or you will
<name="joffrey"> A gold dragon to whoever knocks my fools hat off
<name="tywin"> Youre in rather a good mood
<name="cersei"> I suppose I am
<name="tywin"> I wont ask why
<name="cersei"> Small pleasures
<name="oberyn"> Your Grace Lord Tywin
<name="tywin"> Prince Oberyn
<name="oberyn"> I dont believe you have met Ellaria This is the Lord Hand Tywin Lannister and Cersei Lannister the Queen Regent I suppose it is former Queen Regent now Lord Hand and Lady Cersei, Ellaria Sand
<name="ellaria"> My lord My lady
<name="tywin"> Charmed
<name="cersei"> Cant say Ive ever met a Sand before
<name="ellaria"> We are everywhere in Dorne I have 10,000 brothers and sisters
<name="oberyn"> Bastards are born of passion, arent they? We dont despise them in Dorne
<name="cersei"> No? How tolerant of you
<name="oberyn"> I expect it is a relief, Lady Cersei, giving up your regal responsibilities Wearing the crown for so many years must have left your neck a bit crooked
<name="cersei"> I suppose youll never know, Prince Oberyn Its a shame your older brother couldnt attend the wedding
<name="tywin"> Please give him our regards With any luck, the gout will abate with time and he will be able to walk again
<name="oberyn"> They call it the rich mans disease A wonder you dont have it
<name="tywin"> Noblemen in my part of the country dont enjoy the same lifestyle as our counterparts in Dorne
<name="oberyn"> People everywhere have their differences In some places the highborn frown upon those of low birth In other places the rape and murder of women and children is considered distasteful What a fortunate thing for you, former Queen Regent, that your daughter Myrcella has been sent to live in the latter sort of place
<name="joffrey"> Everyone, silence! Clear the floor Theres been too much amusement here today A royal wedding is not an amusement A royal wedding is history The time has come for all of us to contemplate our history My lords my ladies.
<name="joffrey"> I give you King Joffrey Renly, Stannis, Robb Stark, Balon Greyjoy The War of the Five Kings
<name="renly dwarf"> Im the rightful king
<name="robb dwarf"> King in the North
<name="joffrey dwarf"> Yes
<name="balon dwarf"> Traitor Youre a traitor
<name="joffrey dwarf"> For the Seven Kingdoms
<name="joffrey dwarf"> Let the war begin
<name="stannis dwarf"> Renly, youre no king
<name="balon dwarf"> Away, degenerate Away Away
<name="renly dwarf"> Ooh, careful

<name="renly dwarf"> I want you to be my prince Stannis
<name="balon dwarf"> Whos got the gold now, Stark?
<name="robb dwarf"> I am the rightful king
<name="balon dwarf"> Challenge me, ruffian
<name="robb dwarf"> Take that
<name="balon dwarf"> Im drowning Im drowning
<name="robb dwarf"> I am the King in the North
<name="stannis dwarf"> Not wildfire
<name="tyron"> Pay each of them 20 gold when this is done
<name="podrick"> Yes, my lord
<name="tyrion"> Well have to find another way to thank the king

<name="joffrey dwarf"> Your head
<name="joffrey dwarf"> Fine gentlemen
<name="joffrey"> Well fought Well fought Here you are Champions purse Though youre not the champion yet, are you? A true champion defeats all the challengers Surely there are others out there who still dare to challenge my reign Uncle How about you? Im sure they have a spare costume
<name="tyrion"> One taste of combat was enough for me, Your Grace I would like to keep what remains of my face I think you should fight him This was but a poor imitation of your own bravery on the field of battle I speak as a firsthand witness Climb down from the high table with your new Valyrian sword and show everyone how a true king wins his throne Be careful, though This one is clearly mad with lust It would be a tragedy for the king to lose his virtue hours before his wedding night
<name="tyrion"> A fine vintage Shame that it spilled
<name="joffrey"> It did not spill
<name="margaery"> My love, come back to me Its time for my fathers toast
<name="joffrey"> Well, how does he expect me to toast without wine? Uncle, you can be my cupbearer seeing as youre too cowardly to fight
<name="tyrion"> Your Grace does me a great honor
<name="joffrey"> Its not meant as an honor
<name="joffrey"> Bring me my goblet
<name="joffrey"> What good is an empty cup? Fill it
<name="joffrey"> Kneel Kneel before your king
<name="joffrey"> Kneel I said kneel
<name="margaery"> Look, the pie
<name="joffrey"> My queen
<name="margaery"> Wonderful Wonderful My hero
<name="sansa"> Can we leave now?
<name="tyrion"> Lets find out
<name="joffrey"> Uncle Where are you going? Youre my cupbearer, remember?
<name="tyrion"> I thought I might change out of these wet clothes, Your Grace
<name="joffrey"> No, no, no No, youre perfect the way you are Serve me my wine
<name="joffrey"> Well, hurry up This pie is dry
<name="joffrey"> Mm, good Needs washing down
<name="tyrion"> If it please Your Grace, Lady Sansa is very tired
<name="joffrey"> No No, youll wait here un.
<name="tyrion"> Your Grace?
<name="joffrey"> Its nothing
<name="margaery"> Hes choking
<name="olenna"> Help the poor boy
<name="olenna"> Idiots, help your king
<name="jaime"> Move away
<name="jaime"> Joffrey! Joffrey
<name="cersei"> Help him! Someone help him
<name="cersei"> Joffrey
<name="ser dontos"> Come with me now
<name="cersei"> Joffrey! Joffrey
<name="ser dontos"> If you want to live, we have to leave
<name="cersei"> Dont touch him
<name="cersei"> Joffrey Please, Joffrey Joffrey, what is it? Help him! He reaches a hand out towards TYRION, who at that moment picks up the goblet from before him JOFFREY gaps a final time as blood continues to stream from his nose, his face a horrid shade of purple He dies
<name="cersei"> My son
<name="man"> Hes gone Our king is gone
<name="cersei"> He did this He poisoned my son, your king Take him Take him Take him Take him

<name="theon"> Im Theon Greyjoy, son of Balon, heir to the Iron Islands
<name="ramsay"> And what are you really?
<name="theon"> Im Reek

<name="theon"> Im Reek

<name="ralf"> He wants us to surrender?

<name="ramsay"> You didnt really think Id let them go did you? Its falling out of fashion Fileting Sad, but true Traditions are important Where are we without our history, eh?
<name="theon"> Yes mlord Will we go home now?
<name="ramsay"> I believe we will To our new home
<name="cut to"> THE VALE You have foreign blood, dont you, Baelish?
<name="littlefinger"> A great-grandfather from Braavos, yes I suppose all of our ancestors came from somewhere else originally
<name="lord royce"> Our forebearers settled the Vale thousands of years ago Weve fought off invaders ever since
<name="littlefinger"> The beauty of the Vale is matched only by the nobility of its great families Lady Arryn often told me that you were her rock, Lord Royce
<name="lord royce"> She told me nothing about you, Baelish But I didnt need to hear from her Moneylender Whoremonger Youve been licking Tywin Lannisters boots so long, its a wonder your tongues not black
<name="littlefinger"> My lord.
<name="lord royce"> And when Jon Arryn named you Master of Coin, no one cared Always been a grubby job Why not let a grubby man do it? But when I heard you were lurking here, fawning over the Lady Arryn.
<name="littlefinger"> Lady Arryn invited me She and I have been close since childhood
<name="lady anya"> Yes, we all know how close you were Lady Arryns predilections were her own affair Her death is our affair
<name="littlefinger"> Of course Her suicide shattered us all
<name="lady anya"> She was an odd fish Everyone knew that But suicide? She adored that boy of hers I dont see her abandoning him Not by choice
<name="lord royce"> Strange that within days of your arrival, youve married Lady Arryn and shes fallen through the Moon Door
<name="littlefinger"> She was always prone to melancholy My lady wasnt meant for a world as brutal as ours
<name="lord royce"> We were told there was a witness A girl
<name="lady anya"> A niece of yours, I believe
<name="littlefinger"> A girl with no learning and scattered wits I assure you, she would be of no help
<name="lord royce"> Wed like to speak with her
<name="littlefinger"> Let me fetch her
<name="lady anya"> No need We prefer to hear her testimony unadulterated
<name="lady anya"> Come closer, child You have nothing to fear from us or him Lord Baelish here is your uncle? Your name is Alayne? Perhaps you would feel more comfortable if Lord Baelish left the room
<name="littlefinger"> My lady.
<name="lady anya"> I wasnt asking you
<name="sansa"> He can stay
<name="lord royce"> Speak up, girl, youre not a damn kitchen mouse Tell us what you saw
<name="sansa">   Im sorry, Lord Baelish I have to tell the truth  council tell you everything
<name="lady anya"> Please, Alayne, leave nothing out
<name="sansa"> My name is not Alayne Its Sansa Stark, eldest daughter of Lord Eddard Stark Lord Royce, we met when you came to Winterfell You were escorting your son Ser Waymar to the Wall
<name="lord royce"> Sansa Stark? You tell lies right to my face, you little worm?
<name="sansa"> Lord Baelish has told many lies All to protect me Since my father was executed, I have been a hostage in Kings Landing A plaything for Joffrey to torture or Queen Cersei to torment They beat me, they humiliated me, they married me to the Imp I had no friends in Kings Landing except one He saved me Smuggled me away when he had the chance He knew Id be safe here in the Eyrie with my own blood, my Aunt Lysa The Lannisters have friends everywhere Even the Vale He made me swear not to tell anyone my true name
<name="ser vance"> Your secret is safe with us, my lady
<name="lord royce"> Your father grew up right here in these halls We hunted together many times He was a fine man
<name="lady anya"> Tell us what happened to your aunt, Sansa
<name="sansa"> You knew her well, my lords, my lady You knew she was a troubled woman She always loved Lord Baelish She told me herself From the moment he arrived at the gates of Riverrun, a boy of eight carrying everything he owned in a little sack She confessed to me she never loved Lord Arryn She did as her father commanded, as so many of us have When the gods finally allowed her to be with Lord Baelish, she was so happy For a time My aunt was a jealous lady She was terrified that Lord Baelish didnt love her anymore That he would abandon her for a younger woman And then one day she saw him kiss me
<name="lord royce"> Lady Sansa
<name="sansa"> It was a peck on the cheek, Lord Royce, nothing more Lord Baelish is my uncle now, in truth, by marriage Hes always been so kind to me I was so happy to be here, to be free All because of him But my aunt turned on me She cursed me Called me a whore Promised to throw me through the Moon Door When Lord Baelish tried to calm her, she struck him She said she didnt want to live anymore She stood on the edge of that Moon Door He tried to reason with her Promised her she was the only one he had ever loved, but she stepped through those doors and she was  
<name="lady anya"> Shh Shh, its not your fault, sweet girl Its not your fault
<name="lord royce"> You could see it in the way she raised that boy Feeding him from her own teats when he was 10 years old
<name="lady anya"> Lord Royce! This is hardly the time
<name="lord royce"> Apologies, my lady And to you as well, Baelish We treated you a bit harshly
<name="littlefinger"> You want justice, Lord Royce I can hardly complain about that I want the same
<name="lady anya"> Not much justice to be meted out in suicide, is there?
<name="littlefinger"> For Lysa, no But for her son? Only 20 years ago, the knights of the Vale rode behind Jon Arryn, Ned Stark, Robert Baratheon They fought together to overcome the Mad King And since then, Arryn and Royce, Corbray, Waynwood, all the great houses of the Vale watched from the corner A timid boy at a tavern brawl
<name="lord royce"> Are you questioning our courage?
<name="littlefinger"> I want to know which side youre on Do you support the Lannisters, the house that executed your friend Ned Stark?
<name="lord royce"> Of course we dont support the damn Lannisters
<name="littlefinger"> No? Catelyn Stark begged her sister for support and Lysa refused By staying out of the fray, youve allowed Tywin Lannister to destroy his rivals on every compass point Who stands against him now?
<name="lady anya"> Who would you have us back, Lord Baelish? Robb Stark is dead
<name="littlefinger"> Id have you back Robin Arryn, Lord of the Vale
<name="lady anya"> Robin Arryn is a sickly little boy
<name="littlefinger"> And sickly little boys sometimes become powerful men
<name="lady anya"> More often they die young
<name="littlefinger"> I adored Lysa with all my heart But she loved her son so much, she became overprotective He needs to learn how to swing a sword How to ride a horse
<name="lord royce"> Aye, its time
<name="littlefinger"> Yes, its time Time for him to tour the Vale, to visit all the castles in his domain Time for Robin to leave the nest

<name="ser jorah"> I suspected
<name="dany"> You betrayed me from the first
<name="ser jorah"> Forgive me I never meant please, Khaleesi, forgive me

<name="ser jorah"> I have protected you Fought for you Killed for you
<name="dany"> and you want me to forgive you?
<name="ser jorah"> I have loved you
<name="dany"> Love? Love? How can you say that to me? Any other man, and I would have you executed But you, I do not want you in my city dead or alive Go back to your masters in Kings Landing Collect your pardon if you can
<name="ser jorah"> Daenerys, please

<name="littlefinger"> First time I saw you, you were just a child A girl from the North come to the capital for the first time Not a child any longer Why did you help me?
<name="sansa"> They would have thrown you through the Moon Door if they found you guilty
<name="littlefinger"> Thats not an answer
<name="sansa"> If theyd have executed you, what would they have done with me?
<name="littlefinger"> I dont know
<name="sansa"> Neither do I
<name="littlefinger"> Better to gamble on the man you know than the strangers you dont? And you think you know me?
<name="sansa"> I know what you want
<name="littlefinger"> Do you?
<name="cut to"> OUTSIDE THE VALE
<name="sandor"> I thought itd make me happy, but it doesnt Not really Nothing makes you happy
<name="arya"> Lots of things make me happy
<name="sandor"> Like what?
<name="arya"> Killing Polliver, killing Rorge
<name="sandor"> So youre sad because you didnt get to kill Joffrey yourself Is that it?
<name="arya"> At least I could have been there to watch I wanted to see the look in his eyes when he knew it was over
<name="sandor"> Aye, nothing in the world beats that look
<name="arya"> You protected him for most of his life You think you could have saved him?
<name="sandor"> I wasnt the damn wine taster Little shit deserved to die, but poison poisons a womans weapon Men kill with steel
<name="arya"> Thats your stupid pride talking Its why youll never be a great killer Id have killed Joffrey with a chicken bone if I had to
<name="sandor">   Id pay good money to see that  rubs his neck 
<name="arya"> You should have let me burn it
<name="sandor"> Its a fleabite
<name="arya"> That fleabites got you walking a lot slower than you used to
<name="sandor"> Well, we wont have to walk too much further
<name="arya"> You really think my aunt will pay for me?

<name="sandor"> Doesnt matter Youre her blood Family, honor, all that horseshit Its all you lords and ladies ever talk about
<name="arya"> Im not a lady
<name="guard"> Who would pass the Bloody Gate?
<name="sandor"> The bloody Hound, Sandor Clegane And his traveling companion Arya Stark, niece of your lady Lysa Arryn
<name="guard"> Then I offer my condolences Lady Arryn died Three days ago
<name="cut to"> THE VALE
<name="robin"> Ive never left home before, Uncle Petyr Im afraid to leave
<name="littlefinger"> You shouldnt be
<name="robin"> The Lord of the Vale belongs in the Eyrie, Mother said She said its not safe outside
<name="littlefinger"> It wasnt safe for her inside People die at their dinner tables They die in their beds They die squatting over their chamber pots Everybody dies sooner or later Dont worry about your death Worry about your life Take charge of your life for as long as it lasts That is what it means to be Lord of the Vale
<name="sansa"> Shall we go?
<name="tyrion"> Wine always helps I thank you for it Trial by combat Deciding a mans guilt or innocence in the eyes of the gods by having two other men hack each other to pieces Tells you something about the gods How much longer?
<name="jaime"> Soon
<name="tyrion"> Do you think Oberyn has a chance? The Red Viper of Dorne You dont get a name like that unless youre deadly, right?
<name="jaime"> Ive never seen him fight
<name="tyrion"> Oh, hes going to die Im going to die
<name="jaime"> Oberyn believes in himself
<name="tyrion"> Thats putting it mildly Whats the punishment for regicide? Drawing and quartering? Hanging? Breaking at the wheel?
<name="jaime"> Beheading
<name="tyrion"> Seems rather ordinary And he was my nephew as well, so what is that? Fratricide is brothers Filicide is sons Nepoticide Thats the one Matricide, patricide, infanticide, suicide Theres no kind of killing that doesnt have its own word
<name="jaime"> Cousins
<name="tyrion"> Cousins, youre right There is no word for cousin killing Well done Do you remember cousin Orson? Orson Lannister?
<name="jaime"> Of course Wet-nurse dropped him on his head Left him simple
<name="tyrion"> Simple? Used to sit all day in the garden Crushing beetles with a rock
<name="together"> Khuu! Khuu! Khuu
<name="tyrion"> Nothing made him happier
<name="jaime"> Nothing made you happier Youd think being tormented from birth would have given you some affinity for the afflicted
<name="tyrion"> On the contrary Laughing at another persons misery was the only thing that made me feel like everyone else
<name="jaime"> The joke wore thin, though
<name="tyrion"> For you You drifted away
<name="jaime"> I had other interests
<name="tyrion"> Yes, other interests But I stayed with Orson
<name="jaime"> Why?
<name="tyrion"> I was curious Why was he smashing all those beetles? What did he get out of it? First thing I did was ask him Orson, why are you smashing all those beetles? He gave me an answer Smash the beetles Smash em Khuu! Khuu! Khuu! I wasnt deterred I was the smartest person I knew Certainly I had the wherewithal to unravel the mysteries that lay at the heart of a moron So I went to Maester Volariks library
<name="jaime"> Volarik Tried to touch me once
<name="tyrion"> Turns out, far too much has been written about great men and not nearly enough about morons Doesnt seem right In any case, I found nothing that illuminated the nature of Orsons affliction or the reason behind his relentless beetle slaughter So I went back to the source I may not have been able to speak with Orson, but I could observe him, watch him the way men watch animals to come to a deeper understanding of their behavior  a beetle as I watched, I became more and more sure of it There was something happening there His face was like the page of a book written in a language I didnt understand But he wasnt mindless He had his reasons And I became possessed with knowing what they were I began to spend inordinate amounts of time watching him I would eat my lunch in the garden, chewing my mutton to the music of khuu, khuu, khuu And when I wasnt watching him, I was thinking about him Father droned on about the family legacy and I thought about Orsons beetles I read the histories of Targaryen conquests Did I hear dragon wings? No I heard khuu, khuu, khuu and I still couldnt figure out why he was doing it And I had to know, because it was horrible that all these beetles should be dying for no reason
<name="jaime"> Every day around the world, men, women, and children are murdered by the score Who gives a dusty fuck about a bunch of beetles?
<name="tyrion"> I know, I know But still, it filled me with dread Piles and piles of them, years and years of them How many countless living crawling things smashed and dried out and returned to the dirt? In my dreams I found myself standing on a beach made of beetle husks stretching as far as the eye could see I woke up crying, weeping for their shattered little bodies I tried to stop Orson once
<name="jaime"> He was twice your size
<name="tyrion"> He just pushed me aside with a khuu and kept on smashing Every day until that mule kicked him in the chest and killed him  beetle back on the ground what do you think? Why did he do it? What was it all about?
<name="jaime"> I dont know
<name="jaime"> Good luck today
<name="tyrion"> Looks like very light armor
<name="oberyn"> I like to move around
<name="tyrion"> You could at least wear a helmet You shouldnt drink before a fight
<name="oberyn"> You learn this during your years in the fighting pits? I always drink before a fight
<name="tyrion"> It could get you killed It could get me killed
<name="oberyn"> Today is not the day I die
<name="ellaria"> Youre going to fight that?
<name="oberyn"> Im going to kill that
<name="ellaria"> He is the biggest man Ive ever seen
<name="oberyn"> Size does not matter when you are flat on your back
<name="tyrion"> Thank the gods
<name="pycell"> In the sight of gods and men, we gather to ascertain the guilt or innocence of this man Tyrion Lannister May the Mother grant them mercy May the Father give them such justice as they deserve And may the Warrior guide the hand of our champion.
<name="ellaria"> Dont leave me alone in this world
<name="oberyn"> Never
<name="oberyn"> Have they told you who I am?
<name="mountain"> Some dead man
<name="oberyn"> I am the brother of Elia Martell Do you know why I have come all the way to this stinking shit-pile of a city? For you
<name="oberyn"> Im going to hear you confess before you die You raped my sister You murdered her You killed her children Say it now and we can make this quick
<name="oberyn"> Say it You raped her You murdered her You killed her children
<name="oberyn"> You raped her! You murdered her! You killed her children
<name="oberyn"> You raped her! You murdered her
<name="oberyn"> You killed her children
<name="oberyn"> Wait Are you dying? No, no, no You cant die yet You havent confessed Say it Say her name Elia Martell You raped her You killed her children Elia Martell Who gave you the order? Who gave you the order?! Say her name! You raped her! You murdered her! You killed her children Say it Say her name Say it

<name="jon"> She she had red hair
<name="sam"> Oh? How big were her feet?
<name="jon"> Well what do you want me to say?

<name="jon"> So you and Gilly never
<name="sam"> No she just had a baby! and she never offered
<name="jon"> But if she had, you wouldve? Youd have broken your vows?
<name="sam"> The interesting thing is, our vows never specifically forbid intimate relations with women
<name="jon"> What?
<name="sam"> I shall take no wife yes, thats in there, theres no denying that I shall father no children its very specific But what our vows have to say about other activities is open to interpretation
<name="jon"> I dont think Ser Alliser cares much for interpretation
<name="sam"> Anyway, theres nothing for him to interpret We didnt So whats it like?
<name="jon"> Its theres this person, this whole other person And youre wrapped up in them and theyre wrapped up in you and you for a little for a little while youre more than just you, youre well I dont know, Im not a bleedin poet
<name="sam"> No, youre really not
<name="jon"> And what did I get for it? An arrow six inches from my heart
<name="sam"> Therell be arrows for all of us soon I imagine
<name="jon"> There will
<name="sam"> Theyve already done the worst thing to me they could ever do
<name="jon"> Go get some sleep, Sam Ill take this watch
<name="tormund"> Did I ever tell you about her? My Sheila?
<name="ygritte"> Yes
<name="tormund"> Oh that was a night to remember Of course, Id had a good bit to drink   the fangs were sharp, but she knew how to use them And she was nice and soft down below No, she was no ordinary beast Manys the man who-
<name="ygritte"> I know you never fucked a bear You know you never fucked a bear Right now I dont wanna think about the bear you never fucked Right now all I want to think about is each one of these arrows finding its way into a Crows heart
<name="tormund"> We could be waiting here a while
<name="ygritte"> Good The longer we wait, the more arrows Ill have When they came up here, to our land, and put up a big wall and said it was theirs Then they started hunting us down But this time, were the ones doing the hunting
<name="styr"> Youve got a lot to say about killing Even more words than arrows
<name="ygritte"> Back in those villages I killed just as many of them as you did More, I reckon
<name="styr"> Yes But none of those were your Crow lover
<name="ygritte"> I probably killed him already
<name="styr"> So youve said
<name="ygritte"> And if not The only thing left of him is gonna be his fun-bits hanging around me neck
<name="styr"> And more words Know what I think you do when you see him? Serve him up a nice juicy slice of ginger minge
<name="ygritte"> What, you been thinkin about that ginger minge? Wondering what it tastes like?
<name="styr"> Maybe I have
<name="ygritte"> Jon Snow is mine   Anyone else tries to kill him, Ill have an arrow for them   And not one of your bald friends is fast enough to stop me
<name="aemon"> And what is it that couldnt wait until morning, Tarly?
<name="sam"> Maester Aemon How did you know
<name="aemon"> That it was you? Who else but Samwell Tarly would be wasting candles to read in the middle of the night?
<name="sam"> Let me help you
<name="aemon"> Oh, no need I know my way around this library better than any other place in Castle Black Thousands of books and no eyes to read them Old age is a wonderful source of ironies if nothing else But you didnt answer my question, what are you reading?
<name="sam"> Maester Faull
<name="aemon"> Ah, the Wildlings I can assure you that the closest Maester Faull ever got to a Wildling was this very library
<name="sam"> But what he says about what they do its all true Its exactly what the survivors of their raids report
<name="aemon"> Yes Imagine the stories Wildlings tell about us! Love is the death of duty I told that to your friend Jon Snow once He didnt listen and neither did you Thats why you abandoned your watch atop the wall to come here and read about the things that may have happened to the girl you love
<name="sam"> I dont love her
<name="aemon"> Yes you do
<name="sam"> No
<name="aemon"> Yes you do! I heard it in your voice when you first brought her to me I remember how it sounds! I was in love once
<name="sam"> You were?
<name="aemon"> You can imagine all manner of horrors befalling that poor girl and her child, is it so difficult to imagine that an old person was once, more or less, like you?
<name="sam"> Im sorry Maester, I didnt mean it like that
<name="aemon"> You know who I was before I came here? What I couldve been if Id only said the word? Of course you do I met many girls when I was Aemon Targaryen A future king always does Some of them were quite forward in their attempts to win my affections One of them succeeded I was very young
<name="sam"> Who was she?
<name="aemon"> Ah ha I could tell you everything about her Who she was How we met The color of her eyes and the shape of her nose I can see her right in front of me Shes more real than you are We could spend all night trading tales of lost love Nothing makes the past a sweeter place to visit than the prospect of imminent death Go to bed Tarly
<name="pyp"> Im sorry, I cant open the gate for nobody Its orders
<name="gilly"> They killed everyone! Everyone but me and my baby And theyre out there I saw them on the way here, they may have seen me, they may have followed me please
<name="pyp"> Im sorry, I cant
<name="gilly"> If they find the boy, you dont know what theyll do
<name="sam"> Pyp! Open the gate
<name="pyp"> I cant
<name="gilly"> Sam, is that you?
<name="sam"> Yes
<name="pyp"> Thorne gave me strict orders to not open the gate

<name="alliser"> A hundred thousand you say?
<name="jon"> Yes sir
<name="alliser"> You can say it if you like We shouldve sealed the tunnel while we had the chance like you suggested
<name="jon"> It was a difficult decision either way, Ser
<name="alliser"> Do you know what leadership means, Lord Snow? It means that the person in charge gets second-guessed by every clever little twat with a mouth But if he starts second-guessing himself, thats the end For him For the clever little twats For everyone This is not the end Not for us Not if you lot do your duty for however long it takes to beat them back And then you get to go on hating me and I get to go on wishing your Wildling whore had finished the job
<name="sam"> Youll be safe down here Ill check on you as soon as I can
<name="gilly"> Youre leaving me again?
<name="sam"> Im not leaving you

<name="gilly"> Promise me you wont die
<name="sam"> I promise you I wont die
<name="sam"> Theres a lot more Wildlings on the other side of the wall than this side Weve got us some weapons and things This is the perfect place for us to be
<name="pyp"> Ive never thrown a spear before Ive never held a sword with a proper edge Theres no place for me to be Youre not afraid?
<name="sam"> Of course Im afraid, theres a band of Wildlings coming to kill us
<name="pyp"> Well if youre afraid of a band of Wildlings, how in seven hells did you manage to kill a White Walker?
<name="sam"> I didnt know I was going to kill it, but I had to do something I didnt have any choice, he was going to kill Gilly and take the baby If someone had asked me my name right then, I wouldnt have known I wasnt Samwell Tarly anymore I wasnt a Steward in the Nights Watch or son of Randyll Tarly or any of that I was nothing at all And when youre nothing at all, theres no more reason to be afraid
<name="pyp"> But youre afraid now?
<name="sam"> Yes, well, Im not nothing anymore

<name="tywin"> It is
<name="jaime"> No ones made a Valyrian steel sword since the Doom of Valyria
<name="tywin"> There are three living smiths who know how to rework Valyrian steel The finest of them was in Volantis Came here to Kings Landing at my invitation
<name="jaime"> Where did you get this much Valyrian steel?
<name="tywin"> From someone who no longer had need of it
<name="jaime"> Youve wanted one of these in the family for a long time
<name="tywin"> And now we have two
<name="jaime"> Two?
<name="tywin"> The original weapon was absurdly large Plenty of steel for two swords
<name="jaime"> Well, thank you Its glorious
<name="tywin"> Youll have to train your left hand
<name="jaime"> Any decent swordsman knows how to use both hands
<name="tywin"> Youll never be as good
<name="jaime"> No But as long as Im better than everyone else, I suppose it doesnt matter
<name="tywin"> You cant serve in the Kingsguard with one hand
<name="jaime"> Wheres that written? I can and I will ingsguard oath is for life
<name="tywin"> The war is over The king is safe The king is never safe
<name="jaime"> How many people in this city alone would love to see his head on a pike?
<name="tywin"> Other knights protected the king while you were a prisoner They will continue to do so when you go home
<name="jaime"> Home?
<name="tywin"> Youll return to Casterly Rock and rule in my stead
<name="jaime"> You are the Lord of Casterly Rock
<name="tywin"> I am the Kings Hand My place is here I dont expect to see the Rock again before I die
<name="jaime"> You know what they call me? Kingslayer Oathbreaker Man without honor Now you want me to break another sacred vow
<name="tywin"> You wont be breaking anything There is a precedent to relieve a Kingsguard of his duties The king will exercise that prerogative
<name="jaime"> No
<name="tywin"> No?
<name="jaime"> No
<name="tywin"> I dont believe I asked you a question
<name="jaime"> Theres my answer

<name="tywin"> What do you want?
<name="jaime"> Supper would be nice
<name="tywin"> For 40 years Ive tried to teach you If you havent learned by now, you never will Go If serving as a glorified bodyguard is the sum of your ambition, go serve
<name="jaime"> I suppose you want the sword back
<name="tywin"> Keep it
<name="tywin"> A one-handed man with no family needs all the help he can get
<name="bronn"> How many Dornishmen does it take to fuck a goat?
<name="tyrion"> Please dont
<name="bronn"> Seems to me the smart place to meet travelers is in a tavern That way, one party is late, the other party can drink some ale inside
<name="tyrion"> This is the Prince of Dorne were waiting for, not one of your sellsword friends
<name="bronn"> If hes so damned important, how come they sent you to meet him?
<name="tyrion"> Theres bad blood between the Martells of Dorne and the Lannisters of Casterly Rock Has been for years
<name="bronn"> And just in case the Martells of Dorne are looking to spill some Lannister blood, it may as well be yours, eh?
<name="tyrion"> No need for cynicism I happen to be an accomplished diplomat
<name="bronn"> Oh
<name="tyrion"> Ah, here we are
<name="tyrion"> Can you read the sigils?
<name="bronn"> Yellow balls?
<name="podrick"> Wild lemons on a purple field, House Dalt of Lemonwood A vulture grasping a baby in its talons, House Blackmont A crowned skull, the Manwoodys of Kingsgrave
<name="tyrion"> Boy knows his Dornish Houses
<name="bronn"> I need a sigil
<name="tyrion"> And House Martell, a red sun pierced by a spear?

<name="dornish lord"> Will he?
<name="tyrion"> And where is Prince Oberyn?
<name="dornish lord"> Arrived before dawn Not a man for welcome parties, our prince
<name="tyrion"> Very well My lords, these fine men from the City Watch will escort you to your quarters in the Red Keep
<name="tyrion"> You must be weary after such a long journey
<name="bronn"> Some accomplished diplomacy that was Now where?
<name="tyrion"> We must find Prince Oberyn before he kills somebody or several somebodies
<name="bronn"> How do you plan on finding a single Dornishman in a city this big?
<name="tyrion"> Youre famous for fucking half of Westeros You just arrived at the capital after two weeks of bad roads, where would you go?
<name="bronn"> Id probably go to sleep, but Im getting old
<name="oberyn"> Look at this one How lovely is she?
<name="ellaria"> Beautiful But pale
<name="oberyn"> They like them pale in the capital Shows they dont work the fields Do I frighten you?
<name="oberyn"> You like?
<name="ellaria"> Timid Timid bores me
<name="oberyn"> Youre a bit of mischief, arent you?
<name="oberyn"> I think she likes you ELLARIA She has good taste
<name="oberyn"> Youre not timid, are you?
<name="ellaria"> Not timid
<name="oberyn"> Do you like women?

<name="ellaria"> This one will do nicely
<name="olyvar"> Very good, my lady
<name="ellaria"> Oh, Im not a lady
<name="olyvar"> A term of courtesy in this establishment
<name="ellaria"> A lie anywhere Why not use the right words? Im a bastard She is a whore And youre what? A procurer
<name="olyvar"> Any of the others?
<name="oberyn"> The two girls can leave
<name="oberyn"> You stay
<name="olyvar"> Im afraid Im not an offer, my lord
<name="oberyn"> Everyone who works for Littlefinger is an offer Take off your clothes Well be here a while

<name="morgans friend"> I dont see many Dornishmen in the capital
<name="oberyn"> We dont like the smell
<name="ellaria"> Come with me, lover
<name="morgan"> Gods, look at this one
<name="olyvar"> Sirs, if you follow me, Ill arrange for a private room
<name="morgan"> Why are you wasting a woman like this on a Dornishman? Bring him a shaved goat and a bottle of olive oil
<name="oberyn"> Do you know why all the world hates a Lannister?
<name="oberyn"> You think your gold and your lions and your gold lions make you better than everyone May I tell you a secret? Youre not a golden lion Youre just a pink little man who is far too slow on the draw
<name="oberyn"> Longsword is a bad option in close quarters When I pull my blade, your friend starts bleeding Quite a lot, Im afraid So many veins in the wrist
<name="oberyn"> Hell live if you get him help straightaway So, decisions
<name="tyrion"> Prince Oberyn, forgive the intrusion We heard there might be.
<name="tyrion"> trouble
<name="oberyn"> Apologies, my love
<name="tyrion"> Im here to welcome you to the capital
<name="oberyn"> Ellaria Sand, my paramour The kings own Uncle Imp Tyrion, son of Tywin Lannister
<name="tyrion"> If theres anything I can do to make your stay.
<name="oberyn"> What are you? His hired killer?
<name="bronn"> It started that way, aye Now Im a knight
<name="oberyn"> How did that come to pass?
<name="bronn"> Killed the right people, I suppose
<name="oberyn"> Well need a few more girls Girls, yes? OBERYN You dont partake?
<name="tyrion"> Oh, I partook Now Im married
<name="tyrion"> Prince Oberyn, if I may, a word in private?
<name="oberyn"> Seems I visited the Lannister brothel by mistake
<name="tyrion"> Oh, they take all kinds
<name="oberyn"> Even Dornishmen
<name="tyrion"> The king is very grateful that you traveled all this way for his wedding
<name="oberyn"> Let us speak truth here Joffrey is insulted I am only the second son after all
<name="tyrion"> Well, speaking as a fellow second son, I have grown rather used to being the family insult
<name="tyrion"> Why did you come to Kings Landing, Prince Oberyn?
<name="oberyn"> I was invited to the royal wedding
<name="tyrion"> I thought we were speaking truth
<name="oberyn"> The last time I was in the capital was many years ago Another wedding My sister Elia and Rhaegar Targaryen, the Last Dragon My sister loved him She bore his children Swaddled them, rocked them, fed them at her own breast Elia wouldnt let the wet nurse touch them And beautiful, noble Rhaegar Targaryen left her for another woman That started a war and the war ended right here when your fathers army took the city.
<name="tyrion"> I wasnt actually present
<name="oberyn"> And butchered those children My nephew and niece Carved them up and wrapped them in Lannister cloaks And my sister, you know what they did to her?
<name="oberyn"> Im asking you a question
<name="tyrion"> Ive heard rumors
<name="oberyn"> So have I The one I keep hearing is that Gregor Clegane the Mountain raped Elia and split her in half with his great sword
<name="tyrion"> I wasnt there I dont know what happened
<name="oberyn"> If the Mountain killed my sister, your father gave the order Tell your father Im here And tell him the Lannisters arent the only ones who pay their debts
<name="jorah"> Theyre dragons, Khaleesi They can never be tamed Not even by their mother
<name="daenerys"> Ser Barristan
<name="barristan"> Your Grace
<name="daenerys"> Wheres Daario Naharis? Wheres Grey Worm?
<name="barristan"> Gambling, Your Grace
<name="daenerys"> Gambling?
<name="crowd"> Mhysa Mhysa Mhysa.
<name="daenerys"> How long have they been at it?
<name="missandei"> Since midnight, Your Grace
<name="daario"> Ser Worm is stronger than he looks But I can see his arms beginning to shake
<name="daenerys"> Whats the prize to winning this stupid contest?
<name="daario"> The honor of riding by your side on the road to Meereen
<name="daenerys"> That honor goes to Ser Jorah and Ser Barristan as neither of them kept me waiting this morning You two will ride in the rear guard and protect the livestock
<name="daenerys"> The last man holding his sword can find a new queen to fight for
<name="daario"> You like this girl? Must be frustrating
<name="grey worm"> You are not a smart man, Daario Naharis
<name="daario"> Id rather have no brains and two balls
<name="shae"> You need to eat something
<name="shae"> Pigeon pie
<name="sansa"> No, thank you
<name="shae"> Lemon cakes?
<name="sansa"> No, thank you
<name="shae"> You love lemon cakes
<name="shae"> Tell her she needs to eat
<name="tyrion"> My lady, you do need to eat
<name="sansa"> I dont need to eat
<name="tyrion"> If I could have a moment alone with my wife
<name="shae"> She needs to eat
<name="tyrion"> I cant let you starve
<name="tyrion"> I swore to protect you
<name="tyrion"> My lady, I am your husband Let me help you
<name="sansa"> How can you help me?
<name="tyrion"> I dont know, but I can try
<name="sansa"> I lie awake all night staring at the canopy thinking about how they died
<name="tyrion"> I could get you essence of nightshade to help you sleep
<name="sansa"> Do you know what they did to my brother? How they sewed his direwolfs head onto his body? And my mother They say they cut her throat to the bone and threw her body in the river
<name="tyrion"> What happened to your family was a terrible crime I didnt know your brother He seemed like a good man, but I didnt know him Your mother, on the other hand, I admired her She wanted to have me executed, but I admired her She was a strong woman And she was fierce when it came to protecting her children Sansa Your mother would want you to carry on You know its true
<name="sansa"> Will you pardon me, my lord? Id like to visit the godswood
<name="tyrion"> Of course Of course Prayer can be helpful, I hear
<name="sansa"> I dont pray anymore Its the only place I can go where people dont talk to me
<name="shae"> My lion
<name="tyrion"> What are you doing?
<name="shae"> What does it look like Im doing? Come here
<name="tyrion"> How many times have I told you? You cant visit me here
<name="shae"> I know I know We have come to a dangerous place Have you forgotten me? Do you know how long its been?
<name="tyrion"> Of course I havent forgotten
<name="shae"> I want you Dont you want me?
<name="tyrion"> Things are a bit tense right now
<name="shae"> What things?
<name="tyrion"> My nephew the king wants to murder me My wife hates me because my father murdered her family Oberyn Martell wants to murder everyone whose last name is Lannister
<name="shae"> You need to relax
<name="shae"> Dont you want to relax?
<name="shae"> Whats wrong?
<name="tyrion"> I told you Its not a good time
<name="shae"> Its never a good time You have your child bride now
<name="tyrion"> Shae
<name="shae"> Do you love her?
<name="tyrion"> Love her? I barely know her Shes a child She despises me
<name="shae"> Thats not an answer
<name="tyrion"> Of course I dont love her
<name="shae"> You tried to ship me away
<name="tyrion"> Ship you away?
<name="shae"> Give me diamonds and make me disappear
<name="tyrion"> What in the world are you talking about?
<name="shae"> If you want me to leave, just say it Say it
<name="tyrion"> Shh I dont know what youre talking about
<name="shae"> You want me to stay?
<name="qyburn"> A work of art, really The craftsmanship is excellent
<name="jaime"> You like it so much, youre welcome to chop off your own hand and take it
<name="cersei"> Such an ingrate I spent days with the goldsmith getting the details just right
<name="jaime"> Days?
<name="cersei"> Better part of an afternoon There, how does that feel?
<name="jaime"> Uh a hook would be more practical
<name="cersei"> Elegant, I think
<name="cersie"> Thank you for your help with the other matter
<name="qyburn"> The symptoms have abated?
<name="cersei"> Gone completely I am in your debt, Maester Qyburn

<name="cersei"> Ive grown rather fond of him Hes quite talented, you know?
<name="jaime"> What symptoms?
<name="cersei"> Symptoms that are not your concern
<name="jaime"> You let him touch you?
<name="cersei"> You jealous?
<name="jaime"> Im surprised You never let Pycelle near you
<name="cersei"> You think Id let that old lecher put his hands on me? He smells like a dead cat
<name="jaime"> Im not sure Ive ever smelled a dead cat
<name="cersei"> Well, they smell like Pycelle
<name="jaime"> You drink more than you used to
<name="cersei"> Yes
<name="jaime"> Why?
<name="cersei"> Lets see, you started a brawl in the streets with Ned Stark and disappeared from the capital My husband died in a tragic hunting accident
<name="jaime"> It must have been traumatic for you
<name="cersei"> My only daughter was shipped off to Dorne We suffered through a siege
<name="jaime"> A rather short siege
<name="cersei"> A rather short siege that I didnt expect to survive And now Im marrying my eldest son to a wicked little bitch from Highgarden while Im supposed to marry her brother, a renowned pillow biter So.
<name="jaime"> Father disowned me today
<name="cersei"> He cant disown you Youre all hes got
<name="jaime"> Youre forgetting Tyrion
<name="cersei"> You dont really plan on staying in the Kingsguard, do you?
<name="jaime"> Staying in the Kingsguard means I live right here in the Red Keep with you
<name="cersei"> Not now
<name="jaime"> I want Not now? When? Ive been back for weeks
<name="jaime"> Somethings changed
<name="cersei"> Everythings changed You come back after all this time with no apologies and one hand and expect everything to be the same?
<name="jaime"> What do you want me to apologize for?
<name="cersei"> For leaving me
<name="jaime"> You think I wanted to be taken prisoner?
<name="cersei"> Dont know what you wanted You werent here You left me alone
<name="jaime"> Every day I was a prisoner, I plotted my escape Every day I murdered people so I could be here with you
<name="cersei"> You took too long
<name="jaime"> I What are you saying?
<name="cersei"> Im saying you took too long
<name="cersei"> Come in
<name="jaime"> Go away
<name="marei"> Forgive me, Your Grace You told me to come at once if there was anything important
<name="tormund"> You plan on killing all the crows yourself?
<name="ygritte"> Do you plan on sitting here scratching your balls till winter?
<name="tormund"> We wait for Mances orders
<name="ygritte"> You sent a man over the Wall at the full moon If hes not back yet, hes not coming back
<name="tormund"> And what is it you want? March on Castle Black with just this lot? Your pretty crow said 1,000 men are nesting there
<name="ygritte"> Yeah, well, hes a liar
<name="tormund"> He is? Shouldnt it be he was ? You said you put three arrows in him
<name="ygritte"> I did
<name="tormund"> Ive seen you slip a shaft through a rabbits eye at 200 yards If that boys still walking, its cause you let him go
<name="tormund"> Thenns I fucking hate Thenns
<name="tormund"> Mance sent you?
<name="tormund"> How did you find us?
<name="tormund"> You came from the south, not the north
<name="warg"> Took a detour Got some supper from a village down that way
<name="styr"> Why does the meat down here taste so much better than it does on our side of the Wall?
<name="tormund"> Help yourself
<name="styr"> Maybe everythings just better fed down here
<name="styr"> Fat and lazy Easier for us, hmm?
<name="styr"> You didnt see us coming? Lost your warg? And that baby crow you had with you, lost him too?
<name="tormund"> Ill answer to Mance I wont answer to you
<name="styr"> She yours?
<name="ygritte"> Im not anybodys
<name="styr"> Too scrawny Not like those crows at Castle Black
<name="styr"> Think of them stuck in their larders stuffing their faces with ham and blood sausage and stew, getting nice and fat and marbled
<name="styr"> I know weve had our differences, Tormund, but just one time before you die, you really ought to try crow
<name="officer"> Draw Loose
<name="jon"> Last time I saw him, he was in the courtyard at Winterfell He said, Next time I see you, youll be all in black I was jealous of Robb my whole life The way my father looked at him, I wanted that He was better than me at everything fighting and hunting and riding and girls Gods, the girls loved him I wanted to hate him, but I never could
<name="sam"> Sometimes I want to hate you
<name="sam"> Well, youre better than me at everything Except reading
<name="sam"> Theyre theyre ready for you
<name="jon"> Hes wanted to hang me for a while Nows his chance
<name="sam"> No ones going to hang you Youve done nothing wrong
<name="jon"> Ive done plenty wrong
<name="alliser thorne"> So you admit you murdered Qhorin Halfhand?
<name="jon"> I didnt murder him
<name="alliser thorne"> No? You put your sword through a brother of the Nights Watch What do you call that?
<name="jon"> He wanted me to kill him
<name="janos slynt"> A bastard son of a traitor What would you expect?
<name="jon"> The Halfhand believed our only chance to stop Mance was to get a man inside his army
<name="alliser thorne"> Dont talk about the Halfhand as if you knew him He was my brother
<name="jon"> Then youd know hed do anything to defend the Wall The free folk would have boiled him alive, but letting me kill him.
<name="janos slynt"> The free folk? Listen to him He even talks like a wildling now
<name="jon"> Aye, I talk like a wildling I ate with the wildlings I climbed the Wall with the wildlings I I laid with a wildling girl
<name="janos slynt"> You admit to breaking your vows, then?
<name="jon"> I do
<name="janos slynt"> The law is the law The boy must die
<name="maester aemon"> If we beheaded every ranger who lay with a girl, the Wall would be manned by headless men
<name="alliser thorne"> Theres a difference between sneaking off to the Moles Town brothel and sleeping with the enemy
<name="jon"> While we sit here debating which rules I broke, Mance Rayder marches on the Wall with an army of 100,000
<name="alliser thorne"> Impossible You cant get 50 wildlings together before they start killing each other
<name="jon"> 100,000 Hes united the Thenns, the Hornfoots, the ice-river clans He has giants fighting for him
<name="janos slynt"> Giants?
<name="jon"> Have you ever been beyond the Wall, ser?
<name="janos slunt"> I commanded the City Watch of Kings Landing, boy
<name="jon"> And now youre here You must not have been very good at your job
<name="janos slynt"> How dare you?
<name="jon"> Theres a band of wildlings south of the Wall already led by Tormund Giantsbane I killed their warg and three others They shot me full of arrows Their orders are to attack Castle Black from the south when Mance hits it from the north The signal for the attack will be a bonfire Mance said it would be the greatest fire the North has ever seen Thats the truth All the truth
<name="jon"> Do you intend to execute me or am I free to go?
<name="maester aemon"> None of us are free We are men of the Nights Watch But we wont be taking your head today, Jon Snow Go on
<name="alliser thorne"> I am acting commander here, Maester Aemon
<name="maester aemon"> Yes, you are
<name="alliser thorne"> And I dont trust the bastard
<name="maester aemon"> He told the truth
<name="alliser thorne"> And you always know when a mans telling a lie? How did you acquire this magical power?
<name="maester aemon"> I grew up in Kings Landing
<name="olenna"> No No Youre a queen, not an ox
<name="olenna"> Your grandfather gave me a necklace just like this one for my 51st nameday
<name="margaery"> The wedding is in a fortnight, Grandmother You cant say no to everything
<name="olenna"> Nonsense
<name="olenna"> My little dears Go and speak to the jewelers of Kings Landing Tell them who you are, tell them who sent you The one who brings me the best necklace will get to keep the next best
<name="olenna"> The Margaery Tyrell who walks into the sept a fortnight from now will inspire 1,000 songs Now, how sad it will be if shes wearing rubbish like that
<name="margaery"> Perhaps I should just let Joffrey choose it for me End up with a string of dead sparrow heads around my neck
<name="olenna"> You watch that Even here, even with me
<name="olenna"> My word
<name="brienne"> My lady My lady Please pardon me for interrupting My name is Brienne of Tarth
<name="olenna"> We know who you are Weve heard all about you But hearing is one thing Arent you just marvelous? Absolutely singular
<name="olenna"> I hear you knocked my grandson into the dirt like the silly little boy he is
<name="brienne"> My lady, I know this is a very busy time for you, but if I could just have a moment
<name="olenna"> You dare not refuse
<name="margaery"> A shadow?
<name="brienne"> A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon I swear to you by all the gods it was Stannis He plunged his sword through Renlys heart and disappeared One day, my lady, I will avenge our king
<name="margaery"> Joffrey is our king now
<name="brienne"> I meant no offense
<name="margaery"> And youve given none
<name="jaime"> All the Kingsguard will be on duty, of course Ser Boros will be stationed here Ser Preston will be stationed here beside the primary entertainment Your Grace?
<name="joffrey"> Yes, yes, one guard at the the thing Go on
<name="jaime"> Ser Meryn will guard Lady Margaery and Tommen
<name="meryn"> Ive always guarded the king himself, my lord Ever since your absence
<name="jaime"> And I thank you for it, All very good I dont expect any trouble
<name="meryn"> The people love their king They know who keeps them fed
<name="jaime"> Margaery Tyrell, Ive heard
<name="joffrey"> By my leave They know I saved the city They know I won the war
<name="jaime"> The wars not won Not while Stannis lives
<name="joffrey"> I broke Stannis on the Blackwater Pity you werent there to help, Uncle
<name="jaime"> My apologies, Your Grace I was rather busy
<name="joffrey"> Busy getting captured
<name="jaime"> So this is the famous Book of Brothers ? All the great deeds of all the great Kingsguard Ser Arthur Dayne The Sword of the Morning Led the attack on the Kingswood Brotherhood Defeated the Smiling Knight in single combat Ser Duncan the Tall Four pages for Ser Duncan He must have been quite a man
<name="jaime"> So they say
<name="joffrey"> Ser Jaime Lannister
<name="joffrey"> Someone forgot to write down all your great deeds
<name="jaime"> Theres still time
<name="joffrey"> Is there? For a 40-year-old knight with one hand? How can you protect me with that?
<name="jaime"> I use my left hand now, Your Grace Makes for more of a contest
<name="daenerys"> Have you ever been to Meereen?
<name="missandei"> Several times, Your Grace, with Master Kraznys
<name="daenerys"> And?
<name="missandei"> They say 1,000 slaves died building the Great Pyramid of Meereen
<name="daenerys"> And now an army of former slaves is marching to her gates You think the Great Masters are worried?
<name="missandei"> If theyre smart, Your Grace
<name="daenerys"> You were told to ride at the back of the train
<name="daario"> Yes, my queen But I need to speak to you about something important A matter of strategy
<name="missandei"> Your Grace
<name="daenerys"> All right, what is this matter of strategy?
<name="daario"> A dusk rose
<name="daenerys"> Would you like to walk at the back of the train instead of riding?
<name="daario"> And this ones called ladys lace
<name="daenerys"> Would you like to walk without shoes?
<name="daaerio"> You have to know a land to rule it Its plants, its rivers, its roads, its people Dusk rose tea eases fever Everyone in Meereen knows that Especially the slaves who have to make the tea If you want them to follow you, you have to become a part of their world Strategy
<name="daario"> Harpys Gold No tea from this one Beautiful but poisonous
<name="daenerys"> You are a gambler, arent you?
<name="daario"> Your Grace
<name="jorah"> Theres one on every mile marker between here and Meereen
<name="daenerys"> How many miles are there between here and Meereen?
<name="barristan"> 163, Your Grace Ill tell our men to ride ahead and bury them You dont need to see this
<name="daenerys"> You will do no such thing I will see each and every one of their faces Remove her collar before you bury her

<name="jaime"> Yes, there she is
<name="brienne"> And? You made a promise
<name="jaime"> To return the Stark girls to their mother who is now dead
<name="brienne"> To keep them safe
<name="jaime"> Well, Arya Stark hasnt been seen since her father was killed Where do you think she is? My moneys on dead Theres a certain safety in death, wouldnt you say? And Sansa Stark is now Sansa Lannister Bit of a complication
<name="brienne"> A complication does not release you from a vow
<name="jaime"> What do you want me to do? Kidnap my sister-in-law? And take her where? Where would she be safer than here?
<name="brienne"> Look me in the eye and tell me that you think shell be safe in Kings Landing
<name="jaime"> Are you sure were not related? Ever since Ive returned, every Lannister Ive seen has been a miserable pain in my ass Maybe youre a Lannister, too Youve got the hair for it if not the looks
<name="ser dontos"> Its all right Its all right Its all right

<name="ser dontos"> Yes I have good reason to be Once I was a knight Now Im only a fool Dont you know me?
<name="sansa"> Ser Dontos The kings nameday celebration Im sorry I should have remembered

Season 5
EPISODE "HARDHOME" - 31/05/2015


<name="jorah"> Your Grace, I want to say-
<name="daenerys"> You will not speak How do I know you are who you say you are?
<name="tyrion"> If only I were otherwise
<name="daenerys"> If you are Tyrion Lannister why shouldn’t I kill you? To pay your family back for what it did to mine
<name="tyrion"> You want revenge against the Lannisters? I killed my mother Joanna Lannister the day I was born I killed my father Tywin Lannister with a bow to the heart I am the greatest Lannister killer of our time
<name="daenerys"> So I should welcome you into my service because you murdered members of your own family?
<name="tyrion"> Into your service? Your Grace we have only just met It’s too soon to know if you deserve my service
<name="daenerys"> If you’d rather return to the fighting pits just say the word
<name="tyrion"> When I was a young man I heard a story about a baby born during the worst storm in living memory She had no wealth, no lands, no army, only a name and a handful of supporters, most of whom probably thought they could use that name to benefit themselves They kept her alive, moving her from place to place, often hours ahead of the men who had been sent to kill her She was eventually sold off to some warlord on the edge of the world and that appeared to be that And then a few years later the most well informed person I knew told me that this girl without wealth, lands, or armies had somehow acquired all 3 in a very short span of time, along with three dragons He thought she was our best, last chance to build a better world I thought you were worth meeting at the very least
<name="daenerys"> And why are you worth meeting? Why should I spend my time listening to you?
<name="tyrion"> Because you can not build a better world on your own You have no one at your side who understands that land you want to rule The strengths and the weaknesses of the houses that will either support or oppose you
<name="daenerys"> I have a very large army and very large dragons
<name="tyrion"> Killing and politics aren’t always the same thing When I served as Hand of the King I did quite well with the latter considering the king in question preferred torturing animals to leading his people I could do an even better job advising a ruler worth the name
<name="daenerys"> So you want to advise me Very well What would you have me do with him? I swore I would kill him if he ever returned
<name="tyrion"> I know
<name="daenerys"> Why should the people trust a queen who can’t keep her promises?
<name="tyrion"> Whomever Ser Jorah was when he started informing on you, he is no longer that man I can’t remember seeing the same man as devoted to anything as he is to serving you He claims he would kill for you and die for you, and nothing I have witnessed gives me reason to doubt him And yet he did betray you
<name="tyrion"> Did he have an opportunity to confess his betrayals?
<name="daenerys"> Yes, many opportunities
<name="tyrion"> And did he?
<name="daenerys"> No Not until forced to do so
<name="tyrion"> He worships you He is in love with you, I think But he did not trust you with the truth an unpleasant truth, to be sure but one of great significance to you He did not trust that you would be wise enough to forgive him
<name="daenerys"> So I should kill him?
<name="tyrion"> A ruler who kills those that are devoted to her is not a ruler that inspires devotion And you’re going to need to inspire devotion, and lots of it, if you’re ever going to rule across the Narrow Sea But you cannot have him by your side when you do
<name="daenerys"> Remove Ser Jorah from the city
<name="septa"> Confess
<name="cersei"> My son Let me speak to-
<name="septa"> Confess I meant it
<name="cersei"> My face will be the last thing you see before-
<name="arya"> My name is Lana I’m an orphan When I was 8 I begged enough money to buy my first bucket of oysters, and I sold that bucket and made enough money to buy 2 more
<name="arya"> Iit took a while but I finally saved enough to buy myself an oyster cart Now every morning I make my way down to the canals I pass the fish mongers and the bakers I usually see Lhara, my first customer of the day on my way home Then I turn left onto Moonsinger Lane-
<name="arya"> Left onto Ragman Lane, where I do most of my trade
<name="jaqen"> Lana is very impressive Very industrious She will make a fine servant for the Many Faced God
<name="arya"> How will she serve him?
<name="jaqen"> She will no longer turn left onto Ragman Lane She will turn right and go to Ragman Harbor
<name="arya"> What will she do there?
<name="jaqen"> She will see
<name="arya"> See what?
<name="jaqen"> How can a man tell a girl this If he knew what she would see, there would be no reason to send her
<name="arya"> Oysters, clams and cockles
<name="arya"> Oysters clams and cockles! Oysters clams and cockles
<name="thin man"> Your oysters fresh?
<name="arya"> Best in the city
<name="thin man"> You wouldn’t lie to an old man would you?
<name="thin man"> Very nice Give me 4 With vinegar
<name="man"> It’s my 18th voyage I’ve returned from all of them without a scratch on me
<name="thin man"> Can’t do it
<name="man"> Please I have 3 children Without me here take it you have to, I have 3 children, what will they do? Please you have to! Please! You don’t understand?
<name="jaqen"> The man is a gambler He wages that his sailors ship will make it to its destination It is a strange wager for the captain He only wins if he loses his life
<name="arya"> So why would a captain make the wager in the first place?
<name="jaqen"> A girl tells a man that she has seen
<name="arya"> If the captain dies, the thin man pays his family a lot of money
<name="jaqen"> But perhaps the gambler loses his bet and decides that he doesn’t have to pay after all A destitute woman and her small child, what can they do to such a man if he keeps their money for himself? To whom can they turn for recourse?
<name="arya"> The Many Faced God You said you didn’t know what I would see at the docks
<name="jaqen"> A man had no idea what she would see and what she would not A girl named Lana will return to the docks She will watch the gambler She will come to know as much about him as she knows about herself
<name="arya"> And then what?
<name="jaqen"> A gift for the Thin Man
<name="waif"> She is not ready
<name="jaqen"> Perhaps she is, perhaps she’s not
<name="waif"> And if she’s not?
<name="jaqen"> It is all the same to the Many Faced God
<name="qyburn"> The trial will take place The High Sparrow will be presenting a substantial case against you
<name="cersei"> The charges?
<name="qyburn"> Fornication, treason, incest, the murder of King Robert
<name="cersei"> All lies
<name="qyburn"> Of course, Your Grace My concern is that The Faith does not adhere to the same standards of proof as the crown And I hope you’ll excuse me for saying it, but belief is so often the death of reason
<name="cersei"> I wish you’d said it sooner Any word from Jaime?
<name="qyburn"> I’m afraid not Your Grace, Grand Maester Pycelle has summoned your Uncle Kevan back from Casterly Rock to serve as Hand of the King He now presides over the small council
<name="cersei"> Tell him I need to speak to him
<name="qyburn"> I implored him to visit you but he would not
<name="cersei"> What about my son, the king? If you can visit me then surely the king-
<name="qyburn"> Your arrest, and Queen Margaery’s arrest, the king has not taken well He remains in his chambers, his servants often find his food in the hall Left untouched
<name="cersei"> You need to talk to him, you need to talk to my son to come and see me, come and see his mother
<name="qyburn"> I tried my grace, he wouldn’t see me He wouldn’t see anyone
<name="cersei"> I can’t stay here
<name="qyburn"> There is a way, Your Grace A way out
<name="cersei"> Confess? To the High Sparrow? I won’t I made him I rose him up from nothing, I will not kneel before some barefooted commoner and beg his forgiveness
<name="qyburn"> Goodbye my queen The work continues
<name="sansa"> Why Why Theon
<name="theon"> Not Theon There is no Theon Reek
<name="sansa"> Reek Why did you tell him, Reek?
<name="theon"> I was helping you You were trying to escape, there is no escape Not ever Theon Greyjoy tried to escape The master knew He knows everything He hunted him, he caught him, he strapped him to a cross, and cut away piece after piece until there was no Theon left
<name="sansa"> Good If it weren’t for you I’d still have a family If I could do to you what Ramsay did to you right here, right now, I would
<name="theon"> I deserved everything I deserve to be Reek I did terrible things Turned on Robb Captured Winterfell Killed those boys
<name="theon"> They weren’t those boys”, they were Bran and Rickon They were your brothers, you’d know them since they were born
<name="theon"> They weren’t They were only-
<name="sansa"> Only what?
<name="theon"> I can’t
<name="sansa"> Tell me
<name="theon"> I can’t, not unless the master says.
<name="sansa"> Tell me, they weren’t what?
<name="theon"> They weren’t SANSA Tell me why Bran and Rickon should be dead while you still breathe the air Tell me to my face Theon, tell me that they weren’t your brothers
<name="theon"> They weren’t Bran and Rickon! I couldn’t find them It was two farm boys I killed them and burned them so no one would know
<name="sansa"> You didn’t ?
<name="sansa"> Do you know where they went, Bran and Rickon?
<name="theon"> I can’t talk to you anymore
<name="sansa"> Theon, you have to tell me, do you have any idea where Bran and Rickon-
<name="theon"> Not Theon, Reek
<name="bolton bannerman"> Our scouts tells us he’s got no more than 6000 men More than half of them are mounted, however
<name="roose"> And how high can Stannis’ horses jump? Our walls have been full repaired our walls have been reinforced We have enough food for six months We are more prepared for a siege than they could have ever been All we have to do is wait for them to freeze, starve, and mutiny
<name="roose"> You disagree?
<name="ramsay"> Stannis isn’t from the North You are, father I think you’re missing an opportunity to show the people of the North how House Bolton treats southern invaders
<name="roose"> And what do you recommend?
<name="ramsay"> That we not sit and wait to let Stannis to decide what type of fight this is going to be That we hit first, and hit hard, and leave a feast for the crows
<name="roose"> A smart commander does not surrender a defensive advantage As long as we stay behind these walls they can’t touch us Not to mention that the snow is so deep that we couldn’t get an army through if we wanted to
<name="ramsay"> I don’t need an army I need 20 good men
<name="daenerys"> So have you decided yet? Whether I’m worthy of your service?
<name="tyrion"> Have you decided yet whether you’re going to have me killed?
<name="daenerys"> It’s probably my safest option
<name="tyrion"> I can see why you would think so It’s what your father would have done
<name="daenerys"> And what would your father do?
<name="tyrion"> My father? Who publicly sentenced me to death? I’d say his thoughts on having me killed were abundantly clear
<name="daenerys"> Is that why you killed him?
<name="tyrion"> Some day if you decide not to execute me, I’ll tell you all about why I killed my father And on that day, should it ever come, we’ll need more wine than this
<name="daenerys"> I know what my father was What he did I know the Mad King earned his name
<name="tyrion"> So here we sit, two terrible children of two terrible fathers
<name="daenerys"> I’m terrible?
<name="tyrion"> I’ve heard stories
<name="daenerys"> Why did you travel to the other side of the world to meet someone terrible?
<name="tyrion"> To see if you were the right kind of terrible
<name="daenerys"> Which kind is that?
<name="tyrion"> The kind that prevents your people from being even more so
<name="daenerys"> I did reopen the fighting pits Under my rule murder will once again become entertainment
<name="tyrion"> Yes, that was wise And you agreed to marry someone you loathed for the greater good Very impressive My own sister married someone she loathed as well, though not by choice and certainly not for the greater good, Gods forbid She ended up having him killed
<name="daenerys"> Perhaps it won’t come to that
<name="tyrion"> It’s not impossible that Varys was right about you after all
<name="daenerys"> Varys? King Robert’s spy master?
<name="tyrion"> Yes He was the one who convinced me to come find you He was my travelling companion before Ser Jorah seized that role for himself
<name="daenerys"> Jorah sent my secrets to Varys For 20 years the spider oversaw the campaign to find and kill me
<name="tyrion"> He did what he had to do to survive He did a lot of other things that he didn’t have to do I suspect he’s the main reason you weren’t slaughtered in your crib
<name="daenerys"> But you trust him?
<name="tyrion"> Yes, oddly He might be the only person in the world that I trust Besides my brother
<name="daenerys"> The brother who killed my father
<name="tyrion"> That’s the one
<name="daenerys"> Perhaps I will have you killed after all
<name="tyrion"> Your queenly prerogative I had given up on life until Varys convinced me you might be worth living for You chop off my head? Well, my final days were interesting
<name="daenerys"> I’m not going to kill you
<name="tyrion"> No? Banish me?
<name="daenerys"> No
<name="tyrion"> So if I’m not going to be murdered, and I’m not going to be banished.
<name="daenerys"> You’re going to advise me While you can still speak in complete sentences
<name="tyrion"> Advise you on what?
<name="daenerys"> How to get what I want
<name="tyrion"> The Iron Throne Perhaps you should try wanting something else
<name="daenerys"> If I want jokes I’ll get myself a proper fool
<name="tyrion"> I’m not entirely joking There’s more to the world than Westeros after all How many hundreds of thousands of lives have you changed for the better here? Perhaps this is where you belong Where you can do the most good
<name="daenerys"> I fought so that no child born into Slaver’s Bay would ever know what it was like to be bought or sold I will continue that fight here and beyond But this is not my home
<name="tyrion"> And when you get back to your home, who supports you?
<name="daenerys"> The common people
<name="tyrion"> Let’s be generous and assume that’s going to happen Here in Slaver’s Bay you had the support of the common people and only the common people What was that like, ruling without the rich? House Targaryen is gone, not a single person who shares your blood is alive to support you The Starks are gone as well, our two terrible fathers saw to that The remaining Lannisters won’t back you, not ever Stannis Baratheon won’t back you either, his entire claim to the Throne depends on the illegitimacy of yours That leaves the Tyrells Not impossible, but not enough
<name="daenerys"> Lannister, Targaryen, Baratheon, Stark, Tyrell They’re all just spokes on a wheel This ones on top, then that ones on top and on and on it spins, crushing the people on the ground
<name="tyrion"> It’s a beautiful dream Stopping the wheel You’re not the first person to have dreamt it
<name="daenerys"> I’m not going to stop the wheel I’m going to break the wheel
<name="jorah"> You said whoever wins would fight at the Great Pit in front of the queen I won
<name="master"> You struck me
<name="jorah"> I’ve been flogged if it makes you happy I’m the best you’ve got If I win at the Great Pit how much can you sell me for?
<name="master"> You’re a free man, you could have gone anywhere, why did you come back?
<name="jorah"> Let me fight for her and I belong to you
<name="septa"> Thirsty? Confess
<name="cersei"> I’ll get out of here, you realize Before long
<name="septa"> Confess
<name="cersei"> I can make you a wealthy woman A lady of the court
<name="septa"> Confess
<name="cersei"> I can make sure you die in the most hideous way imaginable, and all I do is sit here imagining ways for you to die
<name="gilly"> Does it hurt?
<name="sam"> No
<name="gilly"> Good
<name="sam"> How are you?
<name="gilly"> I’m not the one who got punched and kicked in the face
<name="sam"> You know what I mean
<name="gilly"> I’m good
<name="sam"> Are you scared?
<name="gilly"> A little
<name="sam"> Me too
<name="sam"> Who’s there?
<name="olly"> Olly
<name="sam"> Come in
<name="olly"> I heard what happened
<name="sam"> Not to worry Men brawl from time to time It’s only natural
<name="olly"> Figured you were hungry
<name="sam"> You’re a good lad
<name="olly"> Wanted to ask you something If you’ve got the time
<name="gilly"> I need to check on baby Sam
<name="sam"> Now then How can I help?
<name="olly"> It’s about the Lord Commander
<name="sam"> Yes?
<name="olly"> He’s going up to Hardhome to save all them wildlings Wildlings killed my mom and dad They killed everyone in my village
<name="sam"> We’ve been fighting them for years
<name="olly"> This wasn’t a fight We were farmers and they slaughtered us So why’s he saving them?
<name="sam"> Wildlings are people, just like us There are good ones and bad ones
<name="olly"> The one he’s travelling with, the one with the red beard, he led the raid on my village
<name="sam"> Olly.
<name="olly"> How can he trust him?
<name="sam"> I’ve seen the army of the dead I’ve seen the white walkers, and they’re coming for us, for all the living And when it’s time we’ll need every last man we can find
<name="olly"> But what if we let the wildings through the gates and they cut our throats while we sleep?
<name="sam"> Jon’s taking a risk, but he has to We don’t stand a chance otherwise Sometimes a man has to make hard choices, choices that might look wrong to others but you know are right in the long run
<name="olly"> You believe that?
<name="sam"> With all my heart
<name="sam"> Try not to worry Olly I’ve been worrying about Jon for years He always comes back
<name="tormund"> You trust me Jon Snow?
<name="jon"> Does that make me a fool?
<name="tormund"> We are fools together now
<name="tormund"> Lord of Bones Been a long time
<name="lord of bones"> Last time I saw you the little crow was your prisoner The other way around now What happened?
<name="tormund"> War
<name="lord of bones"> You call that a war? The greatest army the North has ever seen cut to pieces by a southern king
<name="tormund"> We should gather the elders find somewhere quiet to talk
<name="lord of bones"> You don’t give the orders here
<name="tormund"> I’m not giving an order
<name="lord of bones"> Why aren’t you in chains?
<name="jon"> He’s not my prisoner
<name="lord of bones"> What is he?
<name="jon"> We’re allies
<name="lord of bones"> You fucking traitor! You fight for the crows now
<name="tormund"> I don’t fight for the crows
<name="jon"> We’re not here to fight We’re here to talk
<name="lord of bones"> Is that right? You and the pretty crow do a lot of talking, Tormund And when you’re done talking, do you get down on your knees and suck his cock-
<name="tormund"> Gather the elders and let’s talk
<name="jon"> My name’s Jon Snow I’m Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch We’re not friends We’ve never been friends We won’t become friends today This isn’t about friendship This is about survival This is about putting a 700 foot wall between you and what’s out there
<name="karsi"> You built that wall to keep us out
<name="loboda"> Since when do the crows give 2 shits if we live?
<name="jon"> In normal times we wouldn’t But these aren’t normal times The white walkers don’t care if a man’s Free Folk or Crow We’re all the same to them Meat to their army But together we can beat them
<name="karsi"> Beat the white walkers? Good luck with that Run from them, maybe
<name="jon"> It’s not a trick It’s a gift for those who join us
<name="jon"> Dragonglass A man of the Night’s Watch used one of these daggers to kill a walker
<name="loboda"> You saw this?
<name="jon"> No But I trust the man
<name="karsi"> There are old stories about Dragonglass
<name="loboda"> There are old stories about ice spiders big as hounds
<name="karsi"> And with the things we’ve seen you don’t believe them?
<name="jon"> Come with me and Ill share these weapons
<name="karsi"> Come with you where?
<name="jon"> There are good lands south of the wall The Nights Watch will allow you through the tunnel and allow your people to farm those lands
<name="jon"> I knew Mance Rayder He never wanted a war with the Night’s Watch, he wanted a new life for his people For you We’re prepared to give you that new life
<name="karsi"> If ?
<name="jon"> If you swear you join us when the real war begins
<name="loboda"> Where is Mance?
<name="jon"> He died
<name="loboda"> How?
<name="jon"> I put an arrow through his heart
<name="loboda"> I say we send the Lord Commander back to Castle Black with no eyes
<name="tormund"> None of you saw Mance die! I did The Southern King who broke our army, Stannis, wanted to burn him alive to send him a message Jon Snow defied that cunt’s orders His arrow was mercy What it did took courage, and that’s what we need today the courage to make peace with men we’ve been fighting for generations
<name="karsi"> I lost my father, my uncle, and 2 brothers fighting the damn crows
<name="jon"> I’m not asking you to forget your dead I’ll never forget mine I lost 50 brothers the night that Mance attacked the wall But I’m asking you to think about your children now They’ll never have children of their own if we don’t band together The Long Night is coming and the dead come with it No clan can stop them The free folk can’t stop them The Night’s Watch can’t stop them And all the southern kings can’t stop them Only together, all of us, and even then it might not be enough, but at least then we’ll give the fuckers a fight
<name="karsi"> You vouch for this man, Tormund?
<name="tormund"> He’s prettier than both my daughters, but he knows how to fight He’s young, but he knows how to lead He didn’t have to come to Hardhome He came because he needs us And we need him
<name="loboda"> My ancestors would spit on me if I broke bread with a crow
<name="karsi"> So would mine, but fuck em, they’re dead I’ll never trust a man in black But I trust you, Tormund If you say this is the way, we’re with you
<name="tormund"> This is the way
<name="wildling elder"> I’m with Tormund We stay here we’re dead men At least with King Crow there’s a chance
<name="giant"> Tormund
<name="loboda"> Keep that new life you want to give us Keep your glass, King Crow Soon as you get on his ships they’re gonna slit your throats and dump your bodies to the bottom of the Shivering Sea That’s our enemy That has always been our enemy
<name="karsi"> I fucking hate Thenns
<name="jon"> How many are with us? 5000?
<name="tormund"> I’m not good at counting
<name="jon"> We’re leaving too many behind
<name="tormund"> The free folk are stubborn You know how long it took Mance to band them together 20 fucking years
<name="jon"> And he knew them better than I ever will
<name="tormund"> They’re running out of food and there’s nothing to hunt They’ll come around
<name="karsi"> Johnna is gonna look after you She’s in charge, you listen to her
<name="daughter"> I wanna go with you
<name="karsi"> I need to get the old folks on the boats I’m right behind you, I promise Go on
<name="wun wun"> Lokh kif rukh?
<name="loboda"> Shut the gate
<name="loboda"> Shut the gate!
<name="shouting"> Wait! Open the gate! Let us in! Help us! Please open it
<name="loboda loboda"> Ready your arrows
<name="jon"> Get in line! Get in line
<name="jon"> Hold the line! Hold the line! NIGHT
<name="watch brother"> Lord Commander
<name="jon"> Get them to the ship and come back for me
<name="brother"> But you’ll never make it-
<name="jon"> Now
<name="jon"> You should be on one of those boats
<name="karsi"> So should you ! My little girl has gone on Theyre gonna let them pass the wall even if you’re not there ?
<name="jon"> You have my word I’ve given orders
<name="karsi"> Don’t think you’re gonna be there to enforce those orders
<name="tormund"> If they get through, everyone dies
<name="jon"> Night’s Watch with me! Move! Move! Move
<name="jon"> The Dragonglass
<name="loboda"> You’re with me, lad! Now
<name="loboda"> Get the glass
<name="jon"> The Dragonglass
<name="edd"> Fuck the glass! We’re gonna die here
<name="jon"> Go! Go! Go
<name="tormund"> Wun Wun, to the sea
<name="jon"> Let’s go now Now

<name="tommen"> Do you ever miss Casterly Rock?
<name="cersei"> Theres nothing for me in Casterly Rock
<name="tommen"> Thats where you grew up You always told me that you liked the people there better You said that Kings Landing smelled of horse dung and sour milk

<name="cersei"> Theres no need for such formalities
<name="margaery"> In any event, judging from the Kings enthusiasm, the Queen Mother will be a Queen Grandmother soon
<name="cersei"> Won’t that be a lovely day
<name="margaery"> Can you imagine the celebrations? Theyll ring the bells all day and night
<name="cersei"> Remember Anything you need
<name="roose"> We cant hold the North with terror alone
<name="ramsay"> You cant hold the North if you let these lesser lords insult us
<name="roose"> I sent you there to collect taxes, not bodies
<name="ramsay"> Lord Cerwyn refused to pay Said the Warden of the North would always be a Stark, and hed be damned if he kissed a traitors boot
<name="roose"> He left you no choice
<name="ramsay"> I flayed him living, along with his wife and brother Made his son watch
<name="roose"> And?
<name="ramsay"> The new Lord Cerwyn paid his taxes
<name="roose"> I have something important to tell you Stop eating and listen
<name="roose"> We dont have enough men to hold the North if the other Houses rise up against us Do you understand that?
<name="ramsay"> Our pact with the Lannisters protects
<name="roose"> I had a pact with Tywin Lannister, and Tywin Lannister is dead The remaining Lannisters are a thousand miles away dealing with that fact Theyve never once in the history of the Seven Kingdoms sent their army this far north If you think they will for us, youre a fool We become a great house by entering in alliances with other houses, and parleying those alliances into greater power The best way to forge a lasting alliance isnt by peeling a mans skin off The best way is marriage Now that youre a Bolton by royal decree, its time you married a suitable bride And as it happens, I found the perfect girl to solidify our hold in the North
<name="sansa"> Thats Moat Cailin
<name="littlefinger"> Yes A bit shabby, isnt it? Youve been here before
<name="sansa"> On our way down to Kings Landing, with my father and Arya and where are you taking me?
<name="littlefinger"> Home
<name="sansa"> The Boltons have Winterfell The marriage proposal, it wasnt for you?
<name="littlefinger"> No
<name="sansa"> Roose Bolton murdered my brother He betrayed my family
<name="sansa"> He serves the Lannisters
<name="littlefinger"> For now
<name="sansa"> I wont go
<name="littlefinger"> Winterfell is your home
<name="sansa"> Not anymore
<name="littlefinger"> Always Youre a Stark Dyeing your hair doesnt change that Youre Sansa Stark The eldest surviving child of Ned and Catelyn Stark Your place is in the North
<name="sansa"> I cant marry him You cant make me Hes a traitor A murderer
<name="littlefinger"> Youre not marrying Roose Bolton No, youll be marrying his son and heir, Ramsay One day hell be Warden of the North and you will
<name="sansa"> No
<name="littlefinger"> Sansa
<name="sansa"> No, you cant make me I will starve myself I will die before I have to go there
<name="littlefinger"> I wont force you to do anything Dont you know by now how much I care for you? Say the word and we turn the horses round, but listen to me Listen Youve been running all your life Terrible things happened to your family and you weep You sit alone in a darkened room, mourning their fates Youve been a bystander to tragedy from the day they executed your father Stop being a bystander, do you hear me? Stop running Theres no justice in the world Not unless we make it You loved your family Avenge them
<name="podrick"> How do we get through there?
<name="brienne"> We dont We go around
<name="podrick"> It sets miles out of the way Well lose sight of them
<name="brienne"> Doesnt matter I know where theyre going
<name="brienne"> Arent you getting a bit old to be a squire? How did you end up squiring for the Imp?
<name="podrick"> He hates that nickname
<name="brienne"> Well, hes not here to complain about it, is he?
<name="podrick"> I squired for a knight name Ser Lorimer during the War of the Five Kings One night, he had a bit too much to drink And he was famished, so he borrowed a ham
<name="brienne"> He borrowed it?
<name="podrick"> He wasnt a thief He was drunk and hungry and he wasnt thinking I was drunk too He gave me half the ham Next morning, one of the guards saw him passed out, under a wagon, with the ham bone still in his hand They hanged the man afternoon They tied the noose for me too, but, Lord Tywin heard my family name was Payne So he pardoned me, and sent me to Kings Landing to squire for his son
<name="brienne"> As punishment For both of you
<name="podrick"> It didnt seem that way Lord Tyrion was always very good to me
<name="brienne"> Yes, all of your lords were very kind to you All except me Sorry you have to squire such a nasty person
<name="podrick"> Im not sorry Youre the best fighter Ive ever seen You beat The Hound Im proud to be your squire
<name="brienne"> Im sorry Im always snapping at you
<name="podrick"> If you wouldnt snap at me I wouldnt learn anything
<name="brienne"> You want to be a knight, Pod?
<name="podrick"> Yes
<name="brienne"> Starting tomorrow, well train with the sword twice a day, before we ride in the morning and after we camp for the evening And Im going to show you how to ride properly
<name="podrick"> Thank you
<name="brienne"> I cant knight you, but I can teach you how to fight
<name="podrick"> I suppose thats more important
<name="podrick"> You werent a knight, but you were a Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon, werent you?
<name="brienne"> I was
<name="podrick"> Lord Tyrion said he was a good man
<name="brienne"> He was
<name="podrick"> But how did you end up serving Renly?
<name="brienne"> When I was a girl, my father held a ball Im his only living child, so he wants to make a good match for me He invited dozens of young lords to Tarth I didnt want to go, but he dragged me to the ballroom And it was wonderful None of the boys noticed how mulish and tall I was The shoved each other, and threatened to duel if they thought it was their turn to dance And whispered in my ear how they wanted to marry me and take me back to their castles My father smiled at me and I smiled at him Id never been so happy Till I saw a few of the boys sniggering And then they all started to laugh, they couldnt keep the game going any longer They were toying with me Brienne the Beauty’, they called me Great joke And I realized I was the ugliest girl alive A great lumbering beast I tried to run away, but Renly Baratheon took me in his arms Dont let them see your tears,” he told me They’re nasty little shits The nasty little shits arent worth crying over.” He danced with me and none of the other boys could say a word And he was the kings brother after all
<name="podrick"> But wasnt he Lord Tyrion said he was.
<name="brienne"> Yes, Pod, he liked men, Im not an idiot He didnt love me, he didnt want me, he danced with me because he was kind and he wouldnt see me hurt He saved me from being a joke From that day until his last day And I couldnt save him in return Nothings more hateful than failing to protect the one you love One day, I will avenge King Renly
<name="podrick"> But you said a shadow murdered him How do you fight a shadow?
<name="brienne"> A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon I know it was Stannis I know it in my heart Stannis is a man, not a shadow And a man can be killed
<name="stannis"> Lord Commander
<name="jon"> Your Grace
<name="stannis"> Id like to speak alone
<name="jon"> Olly is my steward now, as I was Lord Commander Mormonts I want him to attend my meetings, to learn from men with experience One day, he might command
<name="stannis"> Very well Have you considered my offer?
<name="jon"> I have And I thank you for it You do me great honor All my life I wanted to be Jon Stark
<name="stannis"> Say the word and you will be
<name="jon"> But I have to refuse you Im Lord Commander of the Nights Watch My place is here
<name="stannis"> Im giving you a chance to avenge your family To take back the castle where you grew up To rule the North
<name="jon"> I wish I could fight beside you Believe me, I do But I swore a sacred vow at the Godswood I pledged my life to the Nights Watch
<name="stannis"> Youre as stubborn as your father And as honorable
<name="jon"> I can imagine no higher praise
<name="stannis"> I didnt mean it as praise Honor got your father killed But if your mind’s made up, I wont try to persuade you
<name="jon"> May I ask, Your Grace, how long you plan to stay at Castle Black?
<name="stannis"> Are you bored of us already?
<name="jon"> You saved us from Mance Rayders army We will never forget that But its a question of survival The Nights Watch cant continue to feed your men and the wildling prisoners indefinitely Winter is coming
<name="stannis"> I know it We march on Winterfell within the fortnight Before the snows trap us here
<name="jon"> And the wildlings?
<name="stannis"> Theyd rather burn than fight for me, so be it I leave their fate to you You could execute them, thats the safest course Or you could see if this Tormund fellow is more willing to compromise than Mance ever was I assume the brothers of the Nights Watch would rather see the wildlings dead
<name="jon"> Most of the brothers, yes Theres little love for the free folk here
<name="stannis"> Youre the Lord Commander Your decision
<name="stannis"> You have many enemies in Castle Black Have you considered sending Alliser Thorne elsewhere? Give him command of Eastwatch-by-the-Sea
<name="jon"> I heard it was best to keep your enemies close
<name="stannis"> Whoever said that didnt have many enemies
<name="davos"> He sees something in you Might not be apparent from his tone, but its the truth He believes in you
<name="jon"> Im sorry I disappointed him
<name="davos"> The king is a complicated man But he wants whats right for the Seven Kingdoms
<name="jon"> As long as hes ruling them
<name="davos"> Hes the one true king He has the blood right to that throne
<name="jon"> I’ve sworn to stay clear of the politics of the Seven Kingdoms
<name="davos"> Have you now? How does the Nights Watch vow go again? I bet youve got it memorized since you got here
<name="olly"> Night gathers and now my watch begins
<name="davos"> Not that bit, the bit at the end
<name="olly"> Im the sword in the darkness, the watcher on the walls, the shield that guards the realm of men I pledge my life
<name="davos"> Wait, thats enough The shield that guards the realm of men.” Thats what you swore to be Now Im not a learned man, but the best way of helping the most people might not be sitting in a frozen castle at the edge of the world It just might mean wading in the muck, getting your boots dirty, and doing what needs to be doing
<name="jon"> And what needs to be done?
<name="davos"> As long as the Boltons rule the North, , the North will suffer Just one mans opinion
<name="arya"> What do you want?
<name="waif"> Who are you?
<name="arya"> What?
<name="waif"> You, who walk in here with a coin you never earned, whose value you do not respect Who are you?
<name="arya"> No one
<name="arya"> Ow! Cunt
<name="waif"> A lie, a sad little lie Who are you?
<name="arya"> I told you, Im no Do that again and
<name="waif"> Who are you?
<name="arya"> Youre about to find out
<name="jaqen"> What are you doing?
<name="waif"> We were only playing The game of faces
<name="jaqen"> A girl is not ready
<name="waif"> Clearly not
<name="arya"> I am ready
<name="jaqen"> For what? For whatever you want To be a Faceless Man To be no one
<name="jaqen"> Whose sword is that? It belongs to Arya Stark Arya Starks sword, Arya Starks clothes, Arya Starks stolen silver A man wonders how is it that no one came to be surrounded by Arya Starks things?
<name="arya"> What do we do with them after we wash them?
<name="man"> Open gates
<name="roose"> Lady Sansa, welcome
<name="sansa"> Lord Bolton
<name="roose"> May I introduce my son, , Ramsay Bolton?
<name="ramsay"> Its an honor to meet you, my Lady
<name="woman"> Ill bring you a bowl of hot water You must want to wash
<name="sansa"> Thank you
<name="woman"> Welcome home, Lady Stark The North remembers
<name="jon"> Sam Maester Aemon?
<name="sam"> He apologizes for not being here Hes not feeling well
<name="jon"> Take good care of him Brothers As you all know too well, its long past time to dig a new latrine pit First Builder Yarwyck and I have decided to appoint a latrine captain to oversee this crucial task Brian Seems like a good job for a ginger
<name="jon"> Ser Alliser You have more experience than any other soldier at Castle Black You proved your valour many times over, while defending the Wall from the wildling attack I name you First Ranger
<name="jon"> Lord Janos Im giving you command of Greyguard
<name="janos"> Greyguard is a ruin
<name="jon"> Yes, the fort is in a sorry state Restore it as best you can First Builder Yarwyck can spare ten of his
<name="janos"> I was charged with the defense of Kings Landing when you were soiling your swaddling clothes Keep your ruin
<name="sam"> Alright, alright! Enough of that
<name="jon"> You mistake me, my Lord That was a command, not an offer Pack your arms and armour, say your farewells, and ride for Greyguard
<name="janos"> I will not go meekly off to freeze and die! Give it to one of the fools who cast a stone for you I will not have it Do you hear me, boy? I will not have it
<name="jon"> Are you refusing to obey my order?
<name="janos"> You can stick your order up your bastard arse
<name="jon"> Take Lord Janos outside
<name="jon"> Olly, bring me my sword
<name="janos"> You cannot do this! Get your hands off me! Scum, all of you! If the boy thinks he can frighten me, hes mistaken, yes, very mistaken
<name="janos"> A disgrace! I have friends, important friends in the capital! Youll see
<name="jon"> If you have any last words, my Lord, now is the time
<name="janos"> I was wrong Youre the Lord Commander! We all serve you Im sorry Not only for this, for all Ive done and said I was wrong! My Lord, please, mercy! Mercy! Ill go! I will! Please Im afraid Ive always been afraid
<name="olyvar"> You have served us well, my son
<name="high septon"> Thank you, Father
<name="olyvar"> Which of the Seven will you worship today?
<name="high septon"> The Maiden
<name="olyvar"> Where is the Maiden?
<name="high septon"> And the Stranger
<name="olyvar"> Two is extra, you realize?
<name="high septon"> Yes, yes
<name="olyvar"> What are you doing? This establishment belong to Lord Petyr Baelish You cant
<name="lancel"> You have profaned our faith The faith of our fathers and forefathers
<name="high septon"> I am the High Septon of the
<name="lancel"> You are a sinner And you shall be punished
<name="crowd"> Sinner! Sinner! Sinner
<name="man"> Repent
<name="crowd"> Sinner! Sinner! Sinner! Sinner! Sinner! Sinner
<name="man"> Shame on you
<name="crowd"> Sinner! Sinner
<name="high septon"> Your Grace, , Grandmaester, Lord Tyrell, , uh
<name="qyburn"> It doesnt matter
<name="high septon"> As the High Septon of the Faith of the Seven I give voice to the will of the Gods and am their foremost servant in this world An insult to me is an insult to the Gods An assault on my person, is an assault on our very religion
<name="cersei"> You were assaulted?
<name="high septon"> I was, by those fanatics who call themselves sparrows’ They humiliated me, they they beat me, they left me naked and bleeding on the cobblestones I am lucky to be alive
<name="qyburn"> I heard this all began in Littlefingers brothel
<name="mace"> High Septon, this is a rather shocking thing to hear
<name="high septon"> I tend to both the highest born, and the lowliest amongst us Even prostitutes may earn the mercy of the Mother
<name="qyburn"> So you were administering to the needs of these devout prostitutes?
<name="pycelle"> A mans private affairs ought to stay private
<name="cersei"> What do you want from us, High Septon?
<name="high septon"> Justice! I ask that you protect our Faith by arresting these criminals and throwing them in the black cells I ask that you execute their leader, this so-called High Sparrow Hes a threat to everything we hold sacred If he goes unpunished
<name="cersei"> And where do I find this man? This High Sparrow?
<name="meryn"> I dont think this is a good idea, Your Grace
<name="cersei"> Nonsense, These are deeply religious people Where can I find the High Sparrow?
<name="man"> Seven blessings
<name="man"> Thank you
<name="man"> Just a little more.
<name="woman"> Thank you ever so for the soup
<name="cersei"> A young man said I would find the High Sparrow back here Where is he?
<name="high sparrow"> High Sparrow? Sounds ridiculous, doesnt it? Like Lord Duckling, or King Turtle So, its meant to Were often stuck with the names our enemies give to us The notion that we are all equal in the eyes of Seven doesnt sit well with some, so they belittle me
<name="woman"> Seven blessings to you
<name="high sparrow"> Seven blessings to you, my dear Its only a name, quite an easy burden to wear Far easier than hers
<name="cersei"> Why no shoes?
<name="high sparrow"> Because I gave them away to someone who needed them more We all do that It stops us from forgetting what we really are
<name="cersei"> Is that why you came to Kings Landing? To remind everyone?
<name="high sparrow"> Everyone? I have a hard enough job reminding myself Oh, I tell them no ones special And they think Im special for telling them so
<name="cersei"> Perhaps theyre right
<name="high sparrow"> It would be comforting to believe that, wouldnt it? The Gods sent you here to tempt me? I hope not I had assumed youd only come here to arrest me For that incident with the High Septon
<name="cersei"> An unacceptable way to treat the chosen representative of the Gods in this world, wouldnt you say?
<name="high sparrow"> Hypocrisy is a boil Lancing a is never pleasant Although, they could have been more careful with the blade
<name="cersei"> The High Septon came to speak to me today He doesnt want me to arrest you, he wants me to execute you
<name="high sparrow"> I wouldnt presume to know your thoughts on the matter
<name="cersei"> My thoughts on the matter align with your own The High Septons behaviour was corrosive, as was his attitude Having a man like that reside in the Sept eats away the Faith from the inside So now he resides in the Red Keeps dungeons instead The Faith and the Crown are the two pillars that hold up this world If one collapses, so does the other We must do everything necessary to protect one another
<name="qyburn"> Your Grace
<name="cersei"> Send a raven with this message to Littlefinger in the Eyrie, or wherever hes slithering about
<name="qyburn"> At once, Your Grace
<name="cersei"> Hows your work coming along?
<name="qyburn"> Very well
<name="cersei"> Youve made progress?
<name="qyburn"> More than Ive expected Still a way to go, but
<name="cersei"> Very good Ill leave you to it then Make sure Littlefinger is clear on the meaning of the word immediately
<name="qyburn"> Shh Easy, friend
<name="ramsay"> She really is lovely I hope I can make her happy
<name="littlefinger"> I hope so too Ive become quite fond of Lady Sansa during our travels together She’s suffered enough
<name="ramsay"> Ill never hurt her You have my word
<name="littlefinger"> Ive heard very little about you Which makes you quite a rare thing, as lords go
<name="ramsay"> I havent been a lord very long I was a bastard
<name="roose"> And youre not anymore Allow me a moment alone with Lord Baelish
<name="ramsay"> Yes, father And thank you, Lord Baelish Im forever in your debt
<name="littlefinger"> He seems pleased
<name="roose"> Shouldnt he be?
<name="littlefinger"> I assure you shes still a virgin Tyrion never consummated the marriage By the law of the land, shes no mans wife Inspect her, if you must
<name="roose"> I leave that to the brothel keeper Its her name I need, not her virtue
<name="littlefinger"> Then I have delivered everything Ive promised
<name="roose"> And you prepared for the consequences When the Lannisters hear Ive wed Sansa Stark to Ramsay
<name="littlefinger"> The Lannister name doesnt mean what it once did Tywin is dead He kept his house in power through sheer will Without him, Jaime has one hand and no allies, Tommen is a soft boy, not a king to fear
<name="roose"> The Queen will be enraged
<name="littlefinger"> Queen Margaery adores Sansa Cersei is Queen Mother, a title whose importance wanes with each passing day
<name="roose"> And yet she still has friends Men in important places, whom she can ask for favours A message for you, from Cersei Lannister A rider arrived from Eyrie, shortly before dawn Apparently, she thinks youre still in the Vale
<name="littlefinger"> A message for me, you say Strange that the seal is broken
<name="roose"> Im sure you understand my position, Lord Baelish If you received word in the night from the Queen Mother, it does make me question our new alliance The Lannisters made you one of the great lords of Westeros Yet, here you are in the North, undermining them Why gamble with your position?
<name="littlefinger"> Every ambitious move is a gamble You gambled when you drove a dagger into Robb Starks heart It appears that your gamble paid off Youre Warden of the North
<name="roose"> I had Tywin Lannister backing Who supports me now? You?
<name="littlefinger"> The Eyrie is mine The last time the lords of the Eyrie formed an alliance with the lords of the North, they brought down the greatest dynasty this world has ever known Id like to borrow one of your birds Cersei will expect a reply
<name="roose"> Id like to read the reply
<name="tyrion"> I have to get out of this wheelhouse
<name="varys"> Volantis is a large city
<name="tyrion"> I have to get out of this wheelhouse
<name="varys"> The likelihood of you being spotted here increases a hundredfold
<name="tyrion"> Mm, I have to get out of this wheelhouse
<name="varys"> Im not sure how many new ways I can find of saying this
<name="tyrion"> I will not be of any use to Daenerys Targaryen if I lose my mind I cant remember the last face I saw that wasnt yours
<name="varys"> Its a perfectly good face
<name="tyrion"> Im losing my mind
<name="varys"> If anyone recognizes you, youll lose more than that
<name="tyrion"> Look, we are thousands of miles from Westeros What am I? One more drunk dwarf
<name="tyrion"> Slaves
<name="varys"> Yes The Volantene masters are very organized Flies for dung shovelers Hammers for builders Tears for whores Lest they forget
<name="priestess"> Lord cast your light upon us
<name="crowd"> Lord cast your light upon us
<name="priestess"> For the night is dark and full of terrors
<name="varys"> We should keep moving
<name="crowd"> For the night is dark and full of terrors
<name="priestess"> I was once as you are now
<name="priestess"> Bought and sold, , scourged and branded.
<name="tyrion"> The only red priest we had in Kings Landing was Thoros of Myr This ones much better looking
<name="priestess"> The Lord of Light hears your voice He hears the king as he hears the slave; he hears the Stone Men in their misery.
<name="tyrion"> Stone men Good luck stopping this spread of grayscale with prayer Youd have better luck dancing away the plague
<name="priestess"> He has sent you a saviour! From the fire she was reborn to remake the world! The Dragon Queen
<name="tyrion"> Were going to meet the Saviour! You should have told me Who doesnt want to meet the Saviour?
<name="tyrion"> Come on Lets find a brothel
<name="man"> It’s good luck to rub a dwarf’s head
<name="tyrion"> Its even better luck to suck a dwarfs cock
<name="tyrion"> See? We blend right in Just two more travellers, mad with lust
<name="varys"> Thank you
<name="tyrion"> Curious hair
<name="man"> The mother of dragons
<name="tyrion"> It appears youre not the only Targaryen supporter
<name="varys"> Someone who inspires priests and whores is worth taking seriously
<name="man"> What makes you worth that much?
<name="blonde prostitute"> I’m magic
<name="man"> I bet you bloody are
<name="tyrion"> Well, , shes taken
<name="varys"> Wherere you going?
<name="tyrion"> I need to speak to someone with hair
<name="tyrion"> Hello?
<name="black haired prostitute"> Hello
<name="tyrion"> Youve got no drink
<name="black haired prostitute"> Youve got no money
<name="tyrion"> Do I look like a man without money? Never trust looks Until quite recently, I was one of the richest men in the world But who needs wealth when you can make a woman laugh? I always pay my debts, Im well known for it
<name="black haired prostitute"> You like her? They all like her They all want to fuck a queen
<name="tyrion"> That’s because they’ve never met a queen
<name="black haired prostitute"> Youre just saying that
<name="tyrion"> You know how to spot a liar If I could pick any girl here, I would pick you
<name="black haired prostitute"> Why?
<name="tyrion"> Because you have a skeptical mind
<name="black haired prostitute"> Alright, then Im warning you We’re gonna have to wash you first
<name="black haired prostitute"> Come on
<name="tyrion"> Im, Im sorry, I cant
<name="black haired prostitute"> Of course you can Youre shy
<name="tyrion"> Im not
<name="black haired prostitute"> Have another drink
<name="tyrion"> Gladly, but this, I cant do Believe me, no one is more shocked than I am I hope it passes What will I do in my spare time? I’ll go for a piss, that’s a start
<name="tyrion"> No need to worry, I was just Oh, I thought you were someone else Shows almost over Im sure the girls inside will be happy to oblige
<name="tyrion"> You made some kind of mistake Why dont you tell me what you think you are doing and

EPISODE "KILL THE BOY" - 10/05/2015


<name="hizdahr"> I am so sorry, my queen He was a good man
<name="daenerys"> Barristan the Bold they called him He crossed a continent to serve me He was a loyal friend And he died in an alley, butchered by cowards who hide behind masks
<name="daario"> We could pull back to the pyramid district, secure it, and use it as a base from which to operate Then we clean the city out, neighborhood by neighborhood, street by street, until the rats have nowhere left to hide
<name="daenerys"> I prefer your earlier suggestion Round up the leaders of each of Meereens great families and bring them to me
<name="hizdahr"> But Im the leader of my family
<name="hizdahr"> No, Your Grace! I had nothing to do with this Your Grace
<name="daenerys"> Walk forward
<name="man"> You cannot do this
<name="daenerys"> Another step
<name="daenerys"> They will eat you, if I tell them to They may eat you even if I don’t Children Some say I should give up on them But a good mother never gives up on her children She disciplines them if she must
<name="daenerys"> But she does not give up on them
<name="daenerys"> Who is innocent? Maybe all of you are, , maybe none of you are Maybe, , I should let the dragons decide
<name="hizdahr"> All men must die
<name="daenerys"> Dont want to overfeed them Tomorrow perhaps
<name="sam"> And though Daenerys maintains her grip on Slavers Bay, forces rise against her from within and without She refuses to leave until the freedom of the former slaves is secure She sounds like quite a woman
<name="aemon"> And shes alone, under siege, no family to guide her or protect her Her last relation thousands of miles away, useless, dying
<name="sam"> Dont say that, Maester Aemon
<name="aemon"> A Targaryen, alone in the world, is a terrible thing
<name="jon"> Maester Aemon
<name="aemon"> Lord Commander
<name="jon"> Sam, Id like to speak to the maester alone
<name="jon"> How are you feeling?
<name="aemon"> Oh, like a hundred-year-old man slowly freezing to death
<name="jon"> I need your advice Theres something I want to do, something I have to do But itll divide the Nights Watch Bitterly Half the men will hate me the moment I give the order
<name="aemon"> Half the men hate you already, Lord Commander Do it
<name="jon"> But you dont know what it is
<name="aemon"> That doesnt matter You do You will find little joy in your command But with luck, you will find the strength to do what needs to be done Kill the boy, Jon Snow Winter is almost upon us Kill the boy, and let the man be born
<name="jon"> Where are the rest of the free folk now? Where have they gone? Who leads them?
<name="tormund"> They followed Mance They wont follow anyone else
<name="jon"> What about you?
<name="tormund"> Hard to lead when youre in chains
<name="jon"> What if I unchained you?
<name="tormund"> Why would you do that?
<name="jon"> Because you are not my enemy And Im not yours
<name="tormund"> You sure seemed like my enemy when you were killing my friends
<name="jon"> For 8,000 years the Nights Watch have sworn an oath to be the shield that guards the realms of men And for 8,000 years weve fallen short of that oath You belong to the realms of men All of you
<name="tormund"> And now everything is going to change?
<name="jon"> It is
<name="tormund"> Why now?
<name="jon"> Because now, , I am Lord Commander of the Nights Watch
<name="tormund"> What would you have me do, , Lord Commander?
<name="jon"> Id have you go north of the Wall Gather the remaining free folk wherever they are and bring them back here Ill open the gates for them and let them through Ill find them lands to settle south of the Wall
<name="tormund"> They wont kneel for you and neither will I
<name="jon"> I dont want them to kneel for me I want them to fight with me when the time comes
<name="tormund"> The day I ask my people to fight with the crows is the day my people cut my guts from my belly and make me eat them
<name="jon"> And how many of your people cant fight? The women, the children, the old, the sick, what happens to them? Youre condemning them to death Worse than death because youre too proud to make peace Or maybe youre not proud Maybe youre just a coward
<name="tormund"> Easy thing to say to a man in chains
<name="jon"> Your people need a leader And they need to get south of the Wall before its too late We dont have much time and they have less The walkers are coming and theyll hit your people first Im not asking you to make peace to save your skin Make peace to save your people
<name="tormund"> Most of them are at Hardhome You know where that is?
<name="jon"> Up on Storrolds Point I can give you 10 horses and nine other men You can get there in a week
<name="tormund"> Well need ships
<name="jon"> Ill talk to King Stannis about lending you his fleet
<name="tormund"> All right, then Youre coming with me Youre the Lord Commander of the Nights Watch They need to hear it from you They need to know the ships they are boarding won’t be torched in the middle of the sea You come with me, or I dont go
<name="man"> Youd bring wildlings here, through our gates?
<name="jon"> Men, women, and children will die by the thousands if we do nothing
<name="man"> Let them die We got our own to worry about Less enemies for us
<name="stannis"> Fewer
<name="davos"> What?
<name="stannis"> Nothing
<name="sam"> There is good farmland in the Gift Land that no one uses now A dozen abandoned villages
<name="man"> And why do you think the farmers abandoned those villages? Because the wildlings raided them for years Cut them down! Just like they did this boys people
<name="allister"> Weve been fighting them all for thousands of years Theyve slaughtered villages Theyve slaughtered our brothers
<name="jon"> And weve slaughtered theirs
<name="edd"> I will follow you anywhere, you know that But they killed Grenn And they killed Pyp They killed 50 of our brothers I cant forget that I cant forgive it
<name="jon"> You were at the Fist of the First Men If we abandon them, you know what they become We can learn to live with the wildlings or we can add them to the army of the dead Whatever they are now, theyre better than that
<name="jon"> Thank you Olly If you have something you want to say to me, say it Its all right
<name="olly"> You dont mean it, do you? Telling the wildlings you want to make peace Youre just doing it to trick them
<name="jon"> Its not a trick
<name="olly"> They burned my village They put an arrow through my fathers head right in front of me They butchered my mother, everyone I ever knew
<name="jon"> I know what its like to lose the people you love I know this is hard for you But winter is coming We know whats coming with it We cant face it alone
<name="olly"> Will there be anything else you need, Lord Commander?
<name="jon"> No
<name="podrick"> Shes far away from the Lannisters This is her home Maybe Lady Sansa is better off here
<name="brienne"> Better off with the Boltons who murdered her mother and brother? Sansas in danger even if she doesnt realize it
<name="brienne"> Thank you Youve lived here a long time?
<name="man"> Aye
<name="brienne"> Did you know Lord Eddard?
<name="man"> I knew him and his father before him The Starks are gone now
<name="brienne"> Not all of them I know whos inside that castle
<name="man"> Everyone knows The Boltons
<name="brienne"> Im not talking about the Boltons I need to get a message to her To Sansa Stark
<name="man"> Who are you?
<name="brienne"> Someone who swore to keep her safe
<name="man"> Swore to who?
<name="brienne"> Her mother
<name="man"> Her mothers dead
<name="brienne"> That doesnt release me from an oath I served Lady Catelyn I serve her still Who do you serve?
<name="ramsay"> Come back here Myranda
<name="myranda"> I saw you staring at her
<name="ramsay"> Im going to marry her That will involve looking at her from time to time
<name="myranda"> You said youd marry me
<name="ramsay"> And I meant it When I was a bastard named Snow But Im a Bolton now What I want is no longer the primary consideration Im furthering a dynasty
<name="myranda"> Do you think shes pretty?
<name="ramsay"> Of course I do Im not blind
<name="ramsay"> You think shes pretty, too Im looking forward to our wedding night But dont worry, Ill have plenty of time for you
<name="myranda"> Perhaps Ill marry, too

<name="sansa"> Id rather have a mother
<name="myranda"> I know Its not the same Still, its good to remember Remember the way things were I almost forgot Theres something else to help you remember
<name="myranda"> Down there at the end

<name="sansa"> Theon?

<name="sansa"> This isnt a strange place This is my home Its the people who are strange
<name="ramsay"> Youre right Very strange More wine, please
<name="ramsay"> I heard you two had reunited A fitting place for it I like to imagine that the last time you spoke was in this very room Are you still angry with him after he what he did? Dont worry The North remembers I punished him for it Hes not ironborn anymore Not Theon Greyjoy anymore Hes a new man A new person, anyway Arent you, Reek?
<name="theon"> Yes, master
<name="ramsay"> Thats his new name, Reek
<name="sansa"> Why are you doing this?

<name="theon"> Im sorry
<name="ramsay"> Look at her, Reek An apology doesnt mean anything if youre not looking the person in the eye

<name="sansa"> Im very happy for you
<name="roose"> From the way shes carrying, Maester Wolkan says it looks like a boy
<name="ramsay"> How can you be sure?
<name="roose"> Sure of what?
<name="ramsay"> That shes pregnant I mean how can you tell?
<name="roose"> Maester Wolkan has assured us beyond all doubt
<name="ramsay"> So how did you manage it?
<name="roose"> Manage what?
<name="ramsay"> Getting her pregnant
<name="roose"> I imagine youre familiar with the procedure
<name="ramsay"> Of course, but how did you find it?
<name="roose"> You disgraced yourself at dinner, parading that creature before the Stark girl
<name="ramsay"> And if its a boy?
<name="roose"> Youre worried about your position
<name="ramsay"> My position is quite clear Im your son until a better alternative comes along
<name="roose"> Youve never asked me about your mother
<name="ramsay"> Why would I? She had me, she died And here we are
<name="roose"> She was a peasant girl Pretty in a common sort of way She was the millers wife Apparently they had married without my knowledge or consent So I had him hanged and I took her beneath the tree where he was swaying She fought me the whole time She was lucky I didnt hang her, too A year later she came to my gates with a squalling baby in her arms A baby she claimed was mine I nearly had her whipped and the child thrown in the river But then I looked at you and I saw then what I see now You are my son Stannis Baratheon has an army at Castle Black But he wont stay for long He wants the Iron Throne, and the road to Kings Landing comes right through Winterfell He means to take the North But the North is ours Its yours and mine Will you help me defeat him?
<name="ramsay"> Yes
<name="gilly"> Is this every book there is?
<name="sam"> Every book there is?
<name="gilly"> In the world
<name="sam"> Well, no There are thousands and thousands of books out there This library is rather small, actually
<name="gilly"> Where you grew up, were there more books?
<name="sam"> My fathers not the most literate man They say the Citadel has the largest library in the world
<name="gilly"> Wheres that?
<name="sam"> The Citadel? In Oldtown
<name="gilly"> Im sorry I dont know things
<name="sam"> Gilly, look at me You know how to do a hundred things I can never do You can build a fire with wet wood You can cook You can stitch a wound
<name="gilly"> I can wash the linens I can sweep the floor
<name="sam"> Well
<name="gilly"> Why does the Citadel have the biggest library?
<name="sam"> Its where they train the maesters
<name="gilly"> Like Maester Aemon?
<name="sam"> I wanted to be one when I was young Instead, I became a man of the Nights Watch Far more adventure up here anyway I wouldnt have met you
<name="sam"> Ah, Your Grace
<name="stannis"> Youre Samwell Tarly?
<name="sam"> I am, Your Grace
<name="stannis"> Your father is Randyll Tarly He defeated my brother at the Battle of Ashford Only battle Robert ever lost I told him he shouldnt go so far west so soon, but he never listened Fine soldier, your father You dont look like a soldier But Im told you killed a white walker
<name="sam"> I did, Your Grace
<name="stannis"> How?
<name="sam"> With a dagger made of dragonglass
<name="stannis"> Dragonglass?
<name="sam"> What the maesters call obsidian
<name="stannis"> I know what it is We have it in Dragonstone Why would obsidian kill a walker?
<name="sam"> I dont know Ive been going through all the old manuscripts hoping to find something, and all Ive learned is that the children of the forest used to hunt with dragonglass
<name="stannis"> The Lady Melisandre told me that death marches on the Wall
<name="sam"> Ive seen it, Your Grace
<name="stannis"> Seen what?
<name="sam"> The army of the dead And when they come
<name="stannis"> We have to know how to fight them Keep reading, Samwell Tarly
<name="stannis"> Its time
<name="davos"> Uh, Your Grace Wouldnt it be better to wait? When Jon Snow returns with the wildlings, we could have thousands more men
<name="stannis"> If Jon Snow returns with the wildlings We cant wait that long We have the advantage, more men, more horses, all fed and rested But every day we wait, the odds shift in Boltons favor This could turn to winter at any moment We have to act now Give the order We march at sunrise
<name="davos"> Ill choose a dozen men to stay and guard the queen and the princess
<name="stannis"> No need, theyre coming with us
<name="davos"> Its a tough road ahead, Your Grace Wont they be safer
<name="stannis"> Here? Half these watchmen are killers and rapists No, they march with us
<name="davos"> As you wish, Your Grace
<name="shireen"> Do you think Father will let me go down into the crypt?
<name="davos"> Beg your pardon?
<name="shireen"> At Winterfell All the Kings in the North are buried there Bran the Builder and King Dorren and
<name="davos"> First things first Its a long march ahead And then we have to take the castle
<name="shireen"> Is there going to be a battle?
<name="davos"> Aye, princess, but you wont be anywhere near
<name="selyse"> Thats enough talk of battle, Ser Davos Youll scare the child
<name="davos"> Yes, my queen
<name="shireen"> Im not scared
<name="davos"> Well, I am When the battle comes, promise youll protect me
<name="shireen"> I promise
<name="stannis"> I hope you know what youre doing with these wildlings I need those ships
<name="jon"> Youll get them back, I swear it Have a safe journey, Your Grace And thank you
<name="missandei"> Youre still too weak
<name="grey worm"> How long have I been here?
<name="missandei"> Three days
<name="grey worm"> Ser Barristan?
<name="grey worm"> I failed him I failed my men, I failed my queen
<name="missandei"> You failed no one You fought bravely You’ll fight again Are you ashamed? You were ambushed, outnumbered There was no way you could have known
<name="grey worm"> This is not why Wounded in war, there is no shame for this I am ashamed because when the knife go in and I fall to the ground, I am afraid
<name="missandei"> All men fear death
<name="grey worm"> No, not death I fear I never again see Missandei from the Island of Naath
<name="missandei"> Now you have given the Masters what they deserve
<name="daenerys"> If I give everyone what they deserve, Ill have no one left to rule Ser Barristan counseled mercy when I took this city right up to the morning he died Daario Naharis thinks I should kill the former Masters and let the rest of the city fend for itself What do you think?
<name="missandei"> Your Grace, I think that I am not fit to have an opinion on these matters
<name="daenerys"> You are as fit as anyone I know You know why Im here And you know who will suffer the most if this all falls apart So what do you think?
<name="missandei"> I can only tell you what I have seen, Your Grace I have seen you listen to your counselors I have seen you lean on their experience when your own was lacking and weigh the choices they put before you And I have seen you ignore your counselors, because there was a better choice One that only you could see
<name="hizdahr"> My, my queen, please do not do this
<name="daenerys"> What about Valar Morghulis ?
<name="hizdahr"> I did not want to die a coward Apparently I do not want to die at all
<name="daenerys"> It takes courage to admit fear And to admit a mistake I came here to tell you that I was wrong I was wrong and you were right About tradition About bringing the people of this city together I will reopen the fighting pits To free men only Slavery will never return to Meereen, not while I live
<name="hizdahr"> Yes, my queen
<name="daenerys"> And in order to forge a lasting bond with the Meereenese people, I will marry the leader of an ancient family Thankfully a suitor is already on his knees
<name="tyrion"> Dont worry Ill be fine Nothing broken, I dont think Where are we now? Not the Rhoyne Long, sullen silences and an occasional punch in the face The Mormont way Lets start over I apologize for before My mouth sometimes runs away from me This doesnt have to be an unpleasant trip Were going to be spending a lot of time together on the way to Meereen
<name="jorah"> We are
<name="tyrion"> What would make our time together truly enjoyable would be some wine
<name="jorah"> No wine
<name="tyrion"> I am a person who drinks People who drink need to keep drinking Otherwise, theyre not
<name="tyrion"> I know where we are Youre taking us through Valyria
<name="jorah"> I am
<name="tyrion"> Have you sailed this route before?
<name="jorah"> No
<name="tyrion"> Youre going to bring Daenerys a souvenir from her ancestral homeland in case Im not enough?
<name="jorah"> I think youll be plenty
<name="tyrion"> You know what they say The Doom still rules Valyria What about the demons and the flames? Arent you afraid of the Doom?
<name="jorah"> No But the pirates are
<name="tyrion"> Oh
<name="tyrion"> The Smoking Sea How many centuries before we learn how to build cities like this again? Thousands of years the Valyrians were the best in the world at almost everything And then
<name="jorah"> And then they werent
<name="tyrion"> And then they werent They held each other close and turned their backs upon the end The hills that split asunder and the black that ate the skies; The flames that shot so high and hot that even dragons burned; Would never be the final sights that fell upon their eyes A fly upon a wall, the waves the sea wind whipped and churned -
<name="jorah"> The city of a thousand years, and all that men had learned; The Doom consumed it all alike, and neither of them turned
<name="tyrion"> I would clap
<name="tyrion"> I suppose this is it, then This is what remains
<name="tyrion"> What was that?
<name="jorah"> Stone Men! Dont let them touch you
<name="jorah"> Get behind
<name="tyrion"> Mormont, cut me free! Mormont
<name="tyrion"> Mormont! Mormont
<name="jorah"> Tyrion? Tyrion Tyrion Tyrion Youre all right
<name="jorah"> Youre heavier than you look Did any of them touch you?
<name="tyrion"> You? Ive seen greyscale before, but nothing like that
<name="jorah"> I suppose thats why they send them there
<name="tyrion"> Itd be kinder to put daggers in their hearts and be done with it Thank you for saving me Of course, I wouldnt have needed saving if you hadnt kidnapped me in the first place So what now?
<name="jorah"> We walk, up the coast With luck, well find a fishing village Maybe another boat
<name="tyrion"> Without luck?
<name="jorah"> Weve got a long walk ahead of us Ill get some wood for a fire Try to get some rest, huh?

<name="myrcella"> Do you think mother will like him
<name="jaime"> If she sees you’re happy, I’m sure she will
<name="myrcella"> And you really believe that?
<name="jaime"> Have you ever known your mother to like anyone aside from her children?
<name="myrcella"> She likes you
<name="jaime"> I’m not so sure about that Listen There’s something I’ve wanted to tell you Something I should have told you long ago So Now that you’ve seen more of the world, you’ve learned how complicated things can be People can be The Lannisters and the Martells have hated each other for years, but you’ve fallen in love with Trystane It was an accident, really, I mean what were the chances? You happen to fall in love with the man you were assigned to marry? My point is we don’t choose whom we love We just It’s beyond our control I sound like an idiot
<name="myrcella"> No you don’t
<name="jaime"> What I’m trying to say What I’m trying and failing to say
<name="myrcella"> I know what you’re trying to say
<name="jaime"> No I’m afraid you don’t
<name="myrcella"> I do
<name="myrcella"> I know About you and mother I think a part of me always knew And I’m glad I’m glad that you’re my father
<name="jaime"> Myrcella?
<name="jaime"> Myrcella?
<name="jaime"> Myrcella?! Myrcella?
<name="tyrion"> You love her, don’t you? How could you not Of course, it’s hopeless for the both of you Sellsword from the fighting pits, a disgraced knight Neither one of you is fit consort for a queen But, we always want the wrong woman
<name="daario"> Does he always talk so much?
<name="grey worm"> Jorah the Andal
<name="jorah"> Torgo Nudho
<name="grey worm"> You should not be here
<name="daario"> No, but he is
<name="grey worm"> Our queen ordered him exiled from city
<name="daario"> Our queen would be dead if not for him
<name="missandei"> It’s true And I would be dead if not for the little man
<name="tyrion"> Dwarf I believe that’s the word Apologies My Valyrian is a bit nostril”
<name="missandei"> A bit rusty”
<name="tyrion"> Rusty” Thank you
<name="grey worm"> I am sorry Sorry I am not there to fight for my queen
<name="daario"> You missed a good scrap
<name="jorah"> None of that matters now The longer we sit here bantering the longer Daenerys is out there in the wilderness
<name="tyrion"> He’s right The dragon headed north If we’re going to find her, that’s where we’re to go
<name="jorah"> We? You’re a Lannister The Queen intends to remove your family from power
<name="tyrion"> And I intend to help her do it
<name="jorah"> You’ve been here for how many days now? I’ve fought for her for years Since she was little more than a child
<name="tyrion"> You betrayed her
<name="jorah"> Careful now
<name="tyrion"> And she exiled you, twice, I believe?
<name="jorah"> The second time thanks to you
<name="tyrion"> Don’t blame me for your crimes, Mormont
<name="daario"> He’s right The Queen exiled Jorah And he’s right, Jorah saved her life Perhaps she feels differently about him now Perhaps not The only way we’ll know is if we ask her
<name="tyrion"> Fine, fine, I suppose he can join us Just as long as he promises not to kill me in my sleep
<name="jorah"> If I ever kill you your eyes will be wide open
<name="daario"> Forgive me, but why would we bring you?
<name="tyrion"> Pardon me?
<name="daario"> Have you ever tracked animals in the wilderness?
<name="tyrion"> Not precisely, but I have other skills that’d be very useful-
<name="daario"> Can you fight?
<name="tyrion"> I have fought I don’t claim to be a great warrior
<name="daario"> Are you good on a horse?
<name="tyrion"> Middling
<name="daario"> So mainly you talk?
<name="tyrion"> And drink I’ve survived so far
<name="daario"> Which I respect But you would not help us on this expedition You would help us here in Meereen, though None of us have any experience governing a city, except for him You want to prove your value to the queen? Prove it right here in Meereen
<name="jorah"> He’s a foreign dwarf that barely speaks the language Why would the Meereenese listen to him?
<name="daario"> They wouldn’t They will listen to Grey Worm
<name="grey worm"> I’ll come with you I’ll find our queen
<name="missandei"> You are not strong enough to go anywhere
<name="grey worm"> I am
<name="daario"> He is, he’s the toughest man with no balls I’ve ever met But you still can’t go The people believe in you They know you speak for the queen
<name="missandei"> It’s true Only the Unsullied can keep the peace in Meereen If you leave, half the city will consume the other half
<name="daario"> And Missandei Our queen trusts no one more than Missandei Certainly not me The queen’s closest confidant, the commander of the Unsullied, and the foreign dwarf with the scarred face Good fortune, my friends, Meereen is ancient and glorious Try not to ruin her Looks like it’s you and me, Jorah the Andal Let’s find some good horses We have so much to talk about
<name="voice"> Hello, old friend
<name="varys"> I thought we were so happy together until you abandoned me
<name="tyrion"> I suppose there’s no point in asking how you found me
<name="varys"> The birds sing in the west, the birds sing in the east If one knows how to listen They tell me you’ve already found favor with the Mother of Dragons
<name="tyrion"> Well, she didn’t execute me, so that’s a promising start Now the heroes are off to find her, and I’m stuck here, trying to placate a city on the brink of civil war Any advice for an old comrade?
<name="varys"> Information is the key You need to learn your enemies’ strengths and strategies You need to learn which of your friends are not your friends
<name="tyrion"> If only I knew someone with a vast network of spies
<name="varys"> If only A grand old city, choking on violence, corruption, and deceit Who could possibly have any experience managing such a massive, ungainly beast?
<name="tyrion"> I did miss you
<name="varys"> Oh, I know
<name="daenerys"> We have to go home
<name="daenerys"> My poor, sweet thing Does it hurt? We have to go home Drogon? Can you take me back to Meereen?
<name="daenerys"> How far did you carry me?
<name="daenerys"> Drogon, we need to return My people need me
<name="daenerys"> Well, there’s no food At the very least you can hunt us some supper
<name="septa"> Confess Confess
<name="cersei"> I have sinned I see that now How could I have been so blind for so long I want to be clean again I want absolution The Crone came to me with her lamp raised high, and with its holy light-
<name="high sparrow"> You wish to make a confession?
<name="cersei"> Once I’ve confessed, will I be free?
<name="sparrow"> Your Grace will be dealt with according to her sins
<name="cersei"> The Mother have mercy then I lay with a man outside the bonds of marriage, I confess
<name="sparrow"> Name him
<name="cersei"> Lancel Lannister
<name="sparrow"> Your cousin And the King’s squire
<name="cersei"> I was lonely and afraid
<name="sparrow"> You had a husband
<name="cersei"> A husband of whoring every chance he got
<name="sparrow"> His sins do not pardon your own
<name="cersei"> May the gods forgive me
<name="sparrow"> Other men?
<name="cersei"> No
<name="sparrow"> No others?
<name="cersei"> No
<name="sparrow"> Speaking falsehoods before the Gods is a great crime You understand this?
<name="cersei"> I do
<name="sparrow"> There are those who say your children were not fathered by King Robert That they are bastards born of incest and adultery
<name="cersei"> A lie A lie from the lips of Stannis Baratheon He wants the Throne, but his brother’s children stand in his way, so he claims they are not his brothers’ The filth There is not one shred of truth to it I deny it
<name="sparrow"> Good But these are terrible charges And the realm must know the truth of them If Your Grace has given honest testimony, your trial will prove your innocence
<name="cersei"> Trial? I have confessed?
<name="sparrow"> To a single sin Others you have denied Your trial will separate the truths from the falsehoods
<name="cersei"> I bow to the wisdom of your High Holiness But if I might beg for just one drop of the Mother’s mercy I haven’t seen my son I don’t know how long it’s been I need to see him Please
<name="sparrow"> You have taken the first step on a path back to righteousness In light of this, I will permit you to return to the Red Keep
<name="cersei"> Thank you Thank you
<name="sparrow"> The Mother is merciful It is her you should thank
<name="cersei"> I will, I will I swear it, day and night
<name="sparrow"> Good
<name="cersei"> Am I free to go?
<name="sparrow"> After your atonement
<name="cersei"> My atonement?
<name="sparrow"> A sinner comes before you Cersei of House Lannister, mother to his Grace King Tommen, widow to his Grace King Robert She has committed the acts of falsehood and fornication She has confessed her sins and begged for forgiveness To demonstrate her repentance, she will cast aside all pride, all artifice, and present herself as the gods made her, to you The good people of the city She comes before you with a solemn heart Shorn of secrets Naked before the eyes of gods and men To make her walk of atonement
<name="septa"> Shame Shame Shame
<name="crowd"> Bitch! Whore! All hail her royal tits
<name="woman"> I’ve had half as many cocks as the queen
<name="man"> Suck me off! Suck me off, you bitch
<name="qyburn"> Your Grace It’s good to have you back Come We’ll take you inside I need to have a look at those feet
<name="qyburn"> May I have the honor of presenting the newest member of the Kingsguard
<name="qyburn"> If it please Your Grace, he’s taken a holy vow of silence He has sworn that he will not speak until all his Grace’s enemies are dead, and the evil has been driven from the realm
<name="davos"> He came to your aid Stannis Now he needs you
<name="jon"> We don’t have enough men to make any difference
<name="davos"> The wildlings will make a difference
<name="jon"> The wildlings won’t ever fight for Stannis, I told you before-
<name="davos"> You saved their bloody lives If they’re going to live in the Seven Kingdoms, safe behind our wall, they ought to fight for the damn place
<name="jon"> It’s not their fight
<name="jon"> Stannis?
<name="davos"> Shireen? The princess?
<name="olly"> Lord Commander It’s one of the wildlings you brought back Says he knows your Uncle Benjen Says he’s still alive
<name="jon"> Are you sure he’s talking about Benjen?
<name="olly"> Says he was first Ranger Said he knows where to find him
<name="alliser"> Man says he saw your uncle at Hardhome the last full moon
<name="jon"> He could be lying
<name="alliser"> Could be There are ways to find out

<name="margaery"> Do you promise?
<name="tommen"> I demand that Ser Loras be freed now
<name="cersei"> Did I arrest him?
<name="tommen"> Well, no But you armed the Faith Militant You gave the High Sparrow an army
<name="cersei"> I did And your wife has every right to criticize Cant allow fanatics to arrest the Queens brother, no matter his perversions
<name="tommen"> Then can I tell Margaery youll have Ser Loras released?
<name="cersei"> I told you I am not holding Ser Loras Youre the King Im sure if you speak to the High Sparrow, hell release the poor boy
<name="kingsguard"> Halt
<name="militant"> His Holiness is praying He will not be disturbed
<name="kingsguard"> Give the order and well tear out this rebel
<name="tommen"> You mean, kill them? Here, in the sept?
<name="kingsguard"> Youll be sending them to meet the Gods that they love

<name="man"> Youre born of sin
<name="woman"> Filthy bastard
<name="tommen"> Well find another way
<name="man"> Abomination
<name="tommen"> My Queen?
<name="tommen"> There was no way to free Ser Loras without violence
<name="margaery"> Youre the King of the Andals, the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, the Protector of the Realm And you let a band of fanatics imprison your brother by law
<name="tommen"> Im going to speak to the High Sparrow
<name="margaery"> Are you? When?
<name="tommen"> I I dont know
<name="margaery"> You dont know?
<name="tommen"> He was praying just now

<name="jon"> Good
<name="stannis"> Lord Commander of the Nights Watch
<name="selyse"> A bastard by some tavern slut
<name="stannis"> Perhaps, but that wasnt Ned Starks way
<name="selyse"> I should have given you a son
<name="stannis"> Not your fault
<name="selyse"> Whose then? I gave you nothing but weakness And deformity
<name="melisandre"> Those scars mean nothing to the Lord of Light
<name="selyse"> My Lady
<name="melisandre"> Her father is the Lords chosen King And her fathers blood runs through her veins
<name="melisandre"> You march on Winterfell soon?
<name="stannis"> We must To beat the snows
<name="melisandre"> Once before you put your faith in Ser Davos and left me behind I hope you wont make that mistake again
<name="stannis"> I wont I need you
<name="melisandre"> You only need faith, my King
<name="stannis"> And you, my Lady, what do you need?
<name="melisandre"> To serve my Lord
<name="sam"> Lord Ashford Lady Caulfield Lord Smallwood
<name="jon"> Never even heard of these people
<name="sam"> They havent heard of you either But we need men and they have some
<name="jon"> And how many men does this Lord Mazin have to send us?
<name="sam"> More than Lord Wibberley
<name="jon"> Not him
<name="sam"> I know, Im sorry, but we need men and supplies And Roose Bolton is the Warden of The North
<name="jon"> He murdered my brother
<name="sam"> We swore to be the Watchers on the Wall We cant watch the Wall with 50 men And we cant get more men without help from the Warden of the North
<name="sam"> Apologies, my Lady
<name="melisandre"> Lord Commander
<name="jon"> How can I help you?
<name="melisandre"> Come with us when we ride south None of us know the castle as well as you do Its hidden tunnels, its weaknesses, its people Winterfell was your home once Dont you want to chase the rats out of it?
<name="jon"> Castle Black is my home now Nights Watch takes no part in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms
<name="melisandre"> Theres only one war Life against death Come Let me show what youre fighting for
<name="jon"> Youre gonna show me some vision in the fire Forgive me, my Lady But I dont trust in visions
<name="melisandre"> No visions No magic Just life
<name="melisandre"> Do you feel my heart beating? This power in you, you resist it, and thats your mistake Embrace it
<name="melisandre"> The Lord of Light made us male and female Two parts of a greater whole We are joining this power Power to make life, power to make light, and power to cast shadows
<name="jon"> I dont think Stannis would like that very much
<name="melisandre"> Then we shouldnt tell him
<name="jon"> I cant
<name="melisandre"> Why?
<name="jon"> I swore a vow I loved another
<name="melisandre"> The dead dont need lovers Only the living
<name="jon"> I know But I still love her
<name="melisandre"> You know nothing, Jon Snow
<name="stannis"> Are you lonely?
<name="shireen"> Just bored
<name="stannis"> My father used to tell me that boredom indicates a lack of inner resources
<name="shireen"> Were you bored a lot, too?
<name="stannis"> I know Castle Black is no place for a child, but I
<name="shireen"> I like it I thought Id be left at home I know mother didnt want to bring me
<name="stannis"> Why do you say that?
<name="shireen"> She told me, I dont want to bring you
<name="stannis"> She shouldnt have said that
<name="shireen"> Are you ashamed of me, father?
<name="stannis"> When you were an infant, , the Dornish trailer landed on Dragonstone His goods were junk except for one wooden doll Hed even sewn a dress on it in the colors of our House No doubt hed heard of your birth, and assumed new fathers were easy targets I still remember how you smiled when I put that doll in your cradle, , and you pressed it to your cheek By the time we burnt the doll, it was too late I was told you would die Or worse, the grayscale would go slow Let you grow just enough to know the world before taking it away from you Everyone advised me to send you to the ruins of Valyria to live out your short life with the Stone men, before the sickness spread to the castle I told them all to go to hell I called in every maester on this side of the world Every healer, every apothecary They stopped the disease and saved your life Because you did not belong across the world with the bloody Stone men You are the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon And you are my daughter
<name="littlefinger"> I thought I might find you here Your Aunt Lyanna
<name="sansa"> Father never talked about her Sometimes Id find him down here, lighting the candles They say she was beautiful
<name="littlefinger"> I saw her once I was a boy, living with your mothers family Lord Whent had a great tourney at Harrenhal Everyone was there The Mad King, your father, Robert Baratheon And Lyanna, she was already promised to Robert You can imagine what it was like for me, a boy from nowhere, with nothing to his name, watching these legendary men, tilting at the lists The last two riders were Barristan Selmy and Rhaegar Targaryen When Rhaegar won, everyone cheered for the prince I remember the girls laughing when he took off his helmet and they saw that silver hair How handsome he was Until he rode right past his wife, Elia Martell, and all the smiles died Ive never seen so many people so quiet He rode past his wife, and he lay a crown of winter roses in Lyannas lap Blue as frost How many tens of thousands had to die because Rhaegar chose your aunt?
<name="sansa"> Yes, he chose her and then he kidnapped her and raped her
<name="littlefinger"> Come Lets speak somewhere the dead cant hear us
<name="sansa"> Dressed for riding?
<name="littlefinger"> I am
<name="sansa"> Where are you going?
<name="littlefinger"> Kings Landing
<name="sansa"> Kings Landing?
<name="littlefinger"> Cersei sent for me We must not let her sniff out any trouble
<name="sansa"> You cant leave me here
<name="littlefinger"> I know how hard it is to live with people you despise, believe me But it wont be for long
<name="sansa"> How do you know?
<name="littlefinger"> Stannis Baratheon garrisons at Castle Black Hell march south to Kings Landing before the winter snows block his way But first, he has to take Winterfell
<name="sansa"> You dont know that
<name="littlefinger"> I do Once he liberates these lands from the Boltons hell rally your fathers bannermen to his cause With the North behind him, Stannis can finally take the Iron Throne
<name="sansa"> You think hell defeat the Boltons?
<name="littlefinger"> He has a larger army Hes the finest military commander in Westeros A betting man would put his money on Stannis As it happens, I am a betting man
<name="sansa"> And if youre right?
<name="littlefinger"> Stannis takes Winterfell, he rescues you from the most despised family in the North Grateful for your late fathers courageous support for his claim, he names you Wardeness of the North
<name="sansa"> But I, I wouldnt Wardeness of the North
<name="littlefinger"> You are the last surviving Stark He needs you
<name="sansa"> What if youre wrong? What if Stannis never attacks Winterfell, or he does and the Boltons defeat him?
<name="littlefinger"> Then you will take this Bolton boy, Ramsay, and make him yours
<name="sansa"> I dont know how to do that
<name="littlefinger"> Of course you do Hes already fallen for you
<name="sansa"> His father frightens me
<name="littlefinger"> He should, hes a dangerous man But even the most dangerous men can be outmaneuvered And you’ve learnt to maneuver from the very best I return before too long Youll be strong without me The North will be yours Do you believe me?
<name="sansa"> I expect Ill be a married woman by the time you return
<name="bronn"> Breakfast
<name="bronn"> That would have been a shit way to die
<name="jaime"> As far as Ive seen, theyre all shit ways to die
<name="bronn"> Aye But your lot like to give the singers a good ending
<name="jaime"> I dont care whats sung about me when Im dead
<name="bronn"> No? Two knights, off to rescue a princess Sounds like a good song to me
<name="jaime"> Sounds like all the rest
<name="jaime"> What about you? What shit way would you choose?
<name="bronn"> In my own keep, drinking my own wine, watching my sons grovel for my fortune
<name="jaime"> How disappointing I thought youd have something more exciting planned
<name="bronn"> Ive had an exciting life I want my death to be boring How do you want to go?
<name="jaime"> In the arms of the woman I love
<name="bronn"> She want the same thing?
<name="jaime"> Lets go
<name="bronn"> The captain to that ship What was he, Braavosi?
<name="jaime"> Pentoshi
<name="bronn"> And hes headed to Oldtown?
<name="jaime"> As I said Why?
<name="bronn"> Whats to stop him from docking down the coast and telling the locals that Jaime Lannisters in Dorne?
<name="jaime"> A bag of gold
<name="bronn"> Im not sure you understand how much people hate your family in this part of the world
<name="jaime"> It was a heavy bag
<name="bronn"> And I bet he swore all kinds of oaths to get it But you wont be around if he breaks them
<name="bronn"> How many you count?
<name="jaime"> Four
<name="bronn"> How many you think you can take?
<name="jaime"> One, if hes slow
<name="rider"> Halt
<name="bronn"> Fucked in the arse Hiya! Morning, lads Glad we found you
<name="rider"> Who are you?
<name="bronn"> Cooper This is Darnell
<name="rider"> Youre from Kings Landing
<name="bronn"> Accent gave me away? Flea Bottom Whelped and whipped
<name="rider"> Why are you here?
<name="bronn"> Our ship capsized in the night We managed to swim ashore It was a near thing, really
<name="jaime"> I thought the sharks would get us
<name="rider"> There are no sharks in Dorne
<name="jaime"> I could have sworn those were shark fins
<name="bronn"> Dolphins maybe
<name="rider"> Throw your swords in the sand
<name="bronn"> Boys, theres no need for this Just, point us in the right direction Well find our way home
<name="rider"> Swords in the sand! Now
<name="bronn"> That one should be slow enough
<name="bronn"> Nice move!
<name="jaime"> Luck
<name="bronn"> You had a wonderful teacher
<name="bronn"> Always wanted a Dornish stallion Beasts can run a day and night without tiring Well ride to the Water Gardens with a nice breeze in our face
<name="jaime"> First we need to bury these bodies
<name="bronn"> Birds have to eat too
<name="jaime"> Corpses raise questions, questions raise armies Were not here to start a war
<name="bronn"> Do you know how long it will take us to dig all those holes?
<name="jaime"> I cant dig very well with one hand Not at all, really
<name="tyene"> Nama
<name="elaria"> Nym, Obara
<name="obara"> Will it be war?
<name="elaria"> Prince Doran will weep for your father, but nothing else We must avenge Oberyn ourselves
<name="obara"> Without Doran we have no army to march against the Lannisters
<name="elaria"> We dont need an army to start a war Queen Cersei loves her children, and we have one of them
<name="nymeria"> We may have a problem
<name="obara"> A ships captain, who found me in Planky Town, claiming he had information to sell He told me he smuggled Jaime Lannister into Dorne
<name="elaria"> Hes come for Myrcella If he gets to her before we do, we lose our only chance for revenge You must choose Dorans way and peace, or my way and war
<name="tyene"> Im with you Always
<name="elaria"> Nym? Obara?
<name="obara"> When I was a child, , Oberyn came to take me to court Id never seen this man, and yet he called himself my father My mother wept, said I was too young, and a girl Oberyn tossed his spear at my feet and said, Girl or boy, we fight our battles But the Gods let us choose our weapons My father pointed to the spear, and then to my mothers tears
<name="obara"> I made my choice long ago
<name="tyrion"> Thank you Who are you?
<name="jorah"> Your captor
<name="tyrion"> Do you have wine?
<name="jorah"> No
<name="tyrion"> I cant sleep without wine
<name="jorah"> Then stay awake
<name="tyrion"> Youre going the wrong way My sisters in Westeros Westeros is west! Were heading east
<name="jorah"> Im not taking you to your sister
<name="tyrion"> You said you were taking me to the Queen
<name="jorah"> I am Queen Daenerys Targaryen Shes the Queen I serve
<name="tyrion"> What a waste of a good kidnapping So happens I was heading there myself
<name="jorah"> What business would you have with the Queen?
<name="tyrion"> Gold and glory Oh, and hate If youve ever met my sister, youd understand So now that its clear were on the same side? A high born knight from the North of Westeros, down on his luck in Essos Dragon epaulettes? Bear sigil breast plate Youre Jorah Mormont I have to ask how, exactly, were you serving your Queen in a whore house, half a world away? Is it possible, that you were running? Why would you be running? And why would she have sent you away? Oh, wait! You were spying on her, werent you? Its all coming back to me! I was drunk through most of the Small Council meetings, but its all coming back You passed notes to Varyss little birds She found out, didnt she? Found out, and exiled you And now you hope to win back her favor with a gift A risky scheme One might even say, desperate Do you think Daenerys would execute me, and pardon you? Id say the reverse is just as likely
<name="daenerys"> Everyone looks happy enough from up here What?
<name="barristan"> I was thinking of all the times your brother made me go with him down from the Red Keep, into the streets of Kings Landing
<name="daenerys"> Why?
<name="barristan"> He liked to walk among the people, he liked to sing to them
<name="daenerys"> He sang to them?
<name="barristan"> Yes Rhaegar would take a spot on the Hook or the Street of Seeds and then hed sing Just like all the other minstrels
<name="daenerys"> And what did you do?
<name="barristan"> I made sure no one killed him And I collected the money Well he liked to see how much he could make
<name="daenerys"> He was good?
<name="barristan"> He was very good Viserys never told you?
<name="daenerys"> He told me Rhaegar was good at killing people
<name="barristan"> Rhaegar never liked killing He loved singing
<name="daenerys"> And what did you do with the money?
<name="barristan"> Well, one time, he gave it to the next minstrel down the street One time, he gave it to an orphanage in Flea Bottom One time we got horribly drunk
<name="dario"> Your Grace Hizdahr is here, waiting in your audience chamber
<name="daenerys"> How many others are there?
<name="dario"> Fifty a hundred
<name="daenerys"> Will you be joining us, Ser Barristan?
<name="dario"> I think I can protect you from Hizdahr Zo Loraq
<name="daenerys"> I think I can protect me from Hizdahr Zo Loraq Go, Ser Barristan Sing a song for me
<name="barristan"> Your Grace
<name="hizdahr"> All men must die But not all can die in glory
<name="missandei"> Glory?
<name="hizdahr"> Why else do men fight? Why did your ancestors cross the Narrow Sea and conquer the Seven Kingdoms? So their names would live on Those who find victory in the fighting pits, will never become kings, but their names will live on Its the best chance theyll ever have
<name="daenerys"> Is that what you used to tell men before you set them to butchering each other for sport?
<name="hizdahr"> Your Grace, today is the traditional start of the fighting season
<name="daenerys"> I do not recognize this tradition
<name="hizdahr"> Traditions are the only thing that will hold this city, your city, together Without them, former slaves and former masters have nothing in common Nothing but centuries of mistrust and resentment I cant promise this is the answer to all our problems, but its a start

EPISODE "THE DANCE OF DRAGONS" - 07/06/2015


<name="davos"> A band of 20 men, maybe less They were in and out before anyone spotted them, burnt our food stores to the ground, all our siege weapons were destroyed, dozens of tents were-
<name="stannis"> Horses?
<name="davos"> We’re still getting a count, but hundreds are dead
<name="stannis"> 20 men rode into our camp without a single guard sounding the alarm?
<name="davos"> The northerners know more about their land than we ever will
<name="stannis"> Put last night’s guards in chains, either they fell asleep or they were conspiring with the enemy Find out the truth and then hang them
<name="davos"> Unless there’s a thaw, we can’t press forward to Winterfell, and we don’t have enough food to get us back to Castle Black
<name="stannis"> We’re not returning to Castle Black
<name="davos"> Forgive me, Your Grace, I never claimed to be an expert in military matters But if we can’t march forward, and we won’t march back
<name="stannis"> Have the dead horses butchered for meat
<name="alliser"> Open the gates
<name="jon"> It was a failure
<name="sam"> It wasn’t
<name="jon"> I went to save them, I failed
<name="sam"> You didn’t fail him, or him, or her Every one of them is alive because of you, and no one else
<name="jon"> I don’t think that fact’s lost on them
<name="alliser"> You have a good heart, Jon Snow It will get us all killed
<name="davos"> You sent for me, Your Grace
<name="stannis"> Find you some healthy horses and a few good men to guard you, I’m sending you back to Castle Black Tell the Lord Commander to send food, supplies, fresh horses, in return when I take the throne I’ll make sure the Night’s Watch has all the men it requires He can guard all 19 castles if he so wishes
<name="davos"> Your Grace, you’ve named me your Hand
<name="stannis"> Yes
<name="davos"> ing’s Hand should never abandon the King, especially in a time of war
<name="stannis"> You’re not abandoning me, you’re obeying a command
<name="davos"> A boy with a scroll could deliver this message
<name="stannis"> And if Jon Snow refuses a boy with a scroll, what does the boy say? I didn’t name you hand for your expertise in military matters, ride for Castle Black, don’t come back empty handed
<name="davos"> Your Grace, perhaps Queen and Princess Shireen could accompany me
<name="stannis"> My family stays with me
<name="davos"> At least let me take Shireen A siege is no place for a little girl
<name="stannis"> My family stays with me
<name="davos"> What’s this one now?
<name="the dance of dragons"> A True Telling by Grand Maester Munkun
<name="davos"> Well that sounds like a proper story
<name="shireen"> Ser Byron Swann wanted to kill the dragon Vhagar He polished his shield for a week, til the steel was like a mirror Then he crouched behind it, and crept forward, hoping the dragon would only see his own reflection
<name="davos"> But the dragon only saw a dumb man, holding a mirrored shield
<name="shireen"> And burnt him to a crisp
<name="davos"> Thus ending the dragonslaying career of Ser Byron Swann I made you something, Princess
<name="davos"> Do you like it?
<name="shireen"> He’s beautiful
<name="shireen"> Thank you
<name="davos"> You’re very welcome
<name="shireen"> Will you make me a doe, too, so that he can have company?
<name="davos"> Of course I will
<name="shireen"> But why am I getting a present?
<name="davos"> Because you deserve it My son was always on me trying to teach me to read Gods, I was stubborn about it Made it this far without reading, seemed to me I could make it to the grave I wish I had listened to them This is my own poor way of saying thank you for teaching me to be a grown up I’ll be gone for a few days, Princess I’ll want to hear all about the dance of dragons when I’m back
<name="shireen"> You’ll just have to read it yourself
<name="jaime"> Prince Doran
<name="doran"> Forgive us, we started without you Please, sit
<name="jaime"> Princess Myrcella
<name="myrcella"> Uncle
<name="jaime"> What a lovely dress
<name="myrcella"> You don’t like it?
<name="jaime"> You must be cold
<name="myrcella"> Not at all The Dornish climate agrees with me
<name="jaime"> Prince Trystane How’s your jaw?
<name="trystane"> A fleabite
<name="ellaria"> What are you doing in Dorne?
<name="jaime"> Looking out for the safety of my niece, the princess Myrcella
<name="doran"> And rather than send a raven or speak to me directly you decided to enter my country in secret and abduct our guest by force
<name="jaime"> We received a threatening message The princess’s necklace in the jaws of a viper
<name="myrcella"> That necklace was stolen from my room
<name="jaime"> Ah Excellent The last meal before the beheading
<name="doran"> We can’t behead you Many in Dorne want war But I’ve seen war I’ve seen the bodies piled on the battlefields I’ve seen the orphans starving in the cities I don’t want to lead my people into that hell
<name="ellaria"> No, you want to break bread with the Lannisters
<name="doran"> And that is precisely what we are doing Let us drink to Tommen, the first of his name, the King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
<name="doran"> King Tommen insists on his sister’s return to the capital?
<name="jaime"> I’m afraid he does
<name="doran"> I cannot disobey my King’s command She will return with you to King’s Landing And my son, Prince Trystane, will accompany you both If the alliance between Dorne and the Iron Throne is to continue, their engagement must stand
<name="jaime"> I accept
<name="doran"> One more thing My brother was named to the small council before his death Your father understood the importance of keeping Dorne in the loop With Oberyn gone, Trystane will take his place on the small council
<name="jaime"> You have my word
<name="ellaria"> The word of a Kingslayer
<name="ellaria"> No wonder you can’t stand You have no spine
<name="doran"> You are mother to four of my nieces, girls I love very much For their sake, I hope you live a long life Talk to me that way again and you won’t
<name="jaime"> May I inquire into the fate of my man?
<name="doran"> Tell me, Ser Jaime, in King’s Landing, how do they punish a commoner who strikes a prince?
<name="jaime"> He said it was just a fleabite The fault is mine Bronn is merely a soldier following my orders If anyone should be punished it’s me
<name="doran"> Prince Trystane must learn judgement if he’s to rule one day I’ll let him decide
<name="trystane"> I have learned the value of mercy from my father I will set your man free
<name="jaime"> You’re a good man
<name="trystane"> On one condition
<name="nymeria"> Why do we play? I’m better than you, I’ll always be better than you Have I ever missed once? I don’t think, I can’t recall You must love humiliation or pain Which do you love most? Humiliation or pain? That one hurt didn’t it? You going to cry? Give up, little sister
<name="tyene"> You’re going to miss
<name="nymeria"> I never miss
<name="tyene"> You will You’re thinking too much Now you’re nervous What if she’s right?
<name="nymeria"> Luck
<name="tyene"> Now it’s my turn
<name="nymeria"> You’re too slow You’ve always been too slow
<name="bronn"> Am I going to be happy at the end of this walk?
<name="areo"> You’ll find out very soon
<name="tyene"> Say it one more time, handsome Who am I?
<name="bronn"> The most beautiful woman in the world
<name="tyene"> And that’s the truth
<name="nymeria"> Slut
<name="jaime"> Prince Doran, Ser Bronn of the Blackwater
<name="nan"> I didn’t realize there were knights of the Blackwater
<name="bronn"> Only the one
<name="jaime"> I believe you’ve already met Prince Trystane
<name="bronn"> Prince Sorry about the other day
<name="jaime"> Prince Trystane here is a man of mercy He’s agreed to grant you your freedom
<name="bronn"> I’m glad to hear it The pie looks good
<name="jaime"> There was one condition
<name="doran"> Perhaps some soup instead?
<name="arya"> Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cock-
<name="man"> How much for your little clam?
<name="arya"> Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels
<name="vile thin man"> Come on
<name="thin man"> Some oysters, girl! I’m talking to you! Girl?! Are you deaf? Girl?
<name="banker"> Lord Tyrell! On behalf of the Iron Bank, may I be the first to welcome you to the free city of Braavos I hope your journey was trouble free
<name="mace"> Bit of chop the last few days but nothing too awful Good to see the old chap is still guarding the Harbor
<name="banker"> And how goes the harvest in the Reach?
<name="mace"> Vintnors say this might be the best year for red grapes in half a century If we come to a satisfactory arrangement, I’ll be sure to send the Arbor’s finest your way
<name="banker"> I’m afraid I don’t partake
<name="mace"> Some consider usury distasteful, dishonorable Pure nonsense, of course
<name="banker"> Im glad we see eye-to-eye on this matter
<name="mace"> Did you know that at one point Maegor the third tried to outlaw it in the Seven Kingdoms? Wanted to arrest anyone caught charging interest and cut off both their hands
<name="banker"> Most unfortunate for the glovers
<name="mace"> If a man charges low interest on a loan then he has nothing to gain and everything to lose, so why charge him? Whereas a reward makes a man willing to gamble
<name="banker"> We are not gamblers here at the Iron Bank, Lord Tyrell
<name="mace"> You are the worlds best gamblers And all those bets you won built this
<name="banker"> I’m afraid I still have a good deal of work to do
<name="mace"> Oh, nonsense Works over Do you sing?
<name="banker"> I dont have that gift
<name="mace"> Its not a gift, it’s a skill, anyone can learn it So give me a kiss by the Long Canall and give me two kisses in Salty Town, for we are going to die, tomorrow The bareheaded beggar, the king with his crown
<name="meryn"> I thought that old shit would never stop singing
<name="man"> It wasn’t bad, though
<name="meryn"> The Tyrells can all rot in hell, treasonous cunts They were going to make that boy-fucker Renly king
<name="meryn"> This is the place, lads The sleekest little minks in Braavos
<name="man"> You’re buying?
<name="meryn"> Oh, I’m buying But I never was good at sharing
<name="brothel keeper"> Sell your fish somewhere else
<name="prostitute"> Oh let her in, Brusco, I’m hungry Come here, sweetness
<name="prostitute"> They say oyster’s get the juices flowing We’ll take half a dozen
<name="arya"> Three coppers

<name="meryn"> Too old
<name="head prostitute"> Brea
<name="meryn"> Too old
<name="head"> I have just the one Anara our most expensive girl, but well worth it, I assure you
<name="meryn"> Too old
<name="meryn"> Do you have what I want or not?
<name="head"> Of course Of course
<name="man"> Fresh? Come on, the lads are hungry
<name="man"> Nothing better for you cock stand than fresh oysters
<name="man"> I’ll have one
<name="head"> Who let this girl in? Shoo shoo

<name="head"> I’ll have you whipped, girl! Go on
<name="man"> Valaar morghulis
<name="jaqen"> And?
<name="arya"> The Thin Man wasn’t hungry today
<name="jaqen"> Perhaps that’s why the man is thin
<name="arya"> Tomorrow
<name="jaqen"> Tomorrow
<name="jaqen"> A girl has work to do
<name="doran"> Your rebellion is over You can swear your allegiance to me now, or you can die
<name="doran"> I believe in second chances I don’t believe in third chances
<name="ellaria"> You write like a 7 year old
<name="jaime"> Your maester kindly agreed to copy it over for me
<name="ellaria"> He didn’t try to make you pay?
<name="ellaria"> Then maybe he’s changed The Queen will be thrilled to know you’ll be bringing her daughter home
<name="jaime"> She will
<name="ellaria"> You love her very much, don’t you?
<name="jaime"> Of course, she’s my niece
<name="ellaria"> I wasn’t talking about her
<name="ellaria"> You think I disapprove Why? Because people disapprove of that sort of thing where you are from? They disapproved of Oberyn and me where you are from Here, no one blinked an eye 100 years ago, no one would have blinked an eye at you if you had been named Targaryen It’s always changing, who we’re supposed to love and who we’re not.The only thing that stays the same is that we want who we want
<name="ellaria"> I know your daughter had no part in the terrible thing that happened to the man I loved Perhaps even you were innocent of that
<name="shireen"> Father Aren’t you cold?
<name="stannis"> No What are you reading?
<name="shireen"> The Dance of Dragons
<name="stannis"> What’s it about?
<name="shireen"> It’s the story of the fight between Rhaenyra Targaryen and her half-brother Aegon for control of the Seven Kingdoms Both of them thought they belonged on the Iron Throne When people started for declaring for one of them or the other, their fight divided the kingdom in two Brothers fought brothers Dragons fought dragons By the time it was over, thousands were dead And it was a disaster for the Targaryens as well They never truly recovered
<name="stannis"> The dance of dragons”? Why is that a dance?
<name="shireen"> That’s just what they call it
<name="stannis"> Doesn’t make much sense
<name="shireen"> I think it’s poetic
<name="stannis"> If you had to choose between Rhaenyra and Aegon, who would you have chosen?
<name="shireen"> I wouldn’t have chosen either It’s all the choosing sides that made things so horrible
<name="stannis"> Sometimes a person has to choose Sometimes the world forces his hand If a man knows what he is and remains true to himself, the choice is not choice at all He must fulfill his destiny and become who he is meant to be However much he may hate it
<name="shireen"> It’s alright, father
<name="stannis"> You don’t even know what I’m talking about
<name="shireen"> It doesn’t matter I want to help you Is there any way I can help?
<name="stannis"> Yes there is
<name="shireen"> Good, I want to I’m the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon and I’m your daughter
<name="stannis"> Forgive me
<name="shireen"> Where’s my father? I want to see my father
<name="melisandre"> It will all be over soon, Princess
<name="shireen"> Where’s my father? No you can’t do this, father where are you?
<name="shireen"> Let me see my father! Where are you, please?
<name="selyse"> It’s what the Lord wants It’s a good thing A great thing
<name="melisandre"> The year is now, my Lord For you we offer up this girl, that you may cleanse her with your fire and that its light may lead our way
<name="selyse"> If we don’t act then we’ll all starve here all of us, but if we make this sacrifice
<name="melisandre"> Accept this token of our faith, my lord and lead us from the darkness Lord of Light show us the way
<name="shireen"> Mother, please mother! Mother, please mother
<name="selyse"> I can’t
<name="stannis"> There’s no other way She has King’s blood
<name="melisandre"> Lord of Light protect us, for the night is dark and full of terrors
<name="shireen"> Mother, don’t do this please! Please help! Don’t do this! Please, father! Mother, help
<name="selyse"> No.
<name="daenerys"> Where have you been?
<name="hizdahr"> Just making sure everything’s in order
<name="announcer"> Free citizens of Meereen! By the blessings of the Graces and her majesty the Queen, welcome to the Great Games
<name="announcer"> My queen, our first contest
<name="who will triumph"> the strong or the quick?
<name="quick"> I fight and die for your glory, oh glorious queen
<name="strong"> I fight and die for your glory, oh glorious queen
<name="hizdahr"> They’re waiting for you Clap your hands
<name="daario"> That one, the smaller man, no question, that’s where you should put your money
<name="tyrion"> The smaller man it is
<name="daenerys"> I’m not putting my money anywhere
<name="hizdahr"> Kings and queens never bet on the games Perhaps you should go find someone who does
<name="daario"> People used to bet against me when I fought in the pits He would have bet against me Common novice mistake
<name="hizdahr"> I have spent much of my life in Meereen, and in my experience, larger men do triumph over smaller man, far more often than not
<name="daenerys"> Has your experience ever involved any actual fighting? You, yourself, have you ever tried to kill a man that was trying to kill you?
<name="daario"> Whenever I got into the pit against a beast like that one, the crowd saw me, all skin and bone back then, then they saw a pile of angry muscles ready to murder me They couldn’t get their money out fast enough But the pile of angry muscles never had any muscles here or here And the big men were always too slow to stop my dagger from going where their muscles weren’t Yes, whenever I saw a beast like that one, standing across from me making his beast faces, I knew I could rest easy
<name="hizdahr"> You don’t approve?
<name="tyrion"> There’s always been more than enough death in the world for my taste I can do without it in my leisure time
<name="hizdahr"> Fair enough, yet it’s an unpleasant question but what great thing has ever been accomplished without killing or cruelty?
<name="tyrion"> It’s easy to confuse what is with what ought to be Especially when what is has worked in your favor
<name="hizdahr"> I’m not talking about myself I’m talking about the necessary conditions of greatness
<name="daenerys"> That is greatness?
<name="hizdahr"> That is a vital part of the great city of Meereen Which has existed long before you arrived and will remain standing long after we have returned to the dirt
<name="tyrion"> My father would have liked you
<name="announcer"> We ask again who will triumph?
<name="daenerys"> One day your great city will return to the dirt as well
<name="hizdahr"> At your command?
<name="daenerys"> If need be
<name="announcer"> A Meereenese champion?
<name="hizdahr"> How many people will die to make this happen?
<name="daenerys"> If it comes to that they would have died for a good reason
<name="hizdahr"> Those men think they’re dying for a good reason
<name="daenerys"> Someone else’s reason
<name="hizdahr"> So your reasons are true, and theirs are false They don’t know their own minds, but you do
<name="tyrion"> Well said, you’re an eloquent man Doesn’t mean you’re wrong In my experience, eloquent men are right every bit as often as imbeciles
<name="announcer"> or a Westerosi Knight?
<name="jorah"> I fight and die for your glory, oh glorious Queen
<name="hizdahr"> Your Grace-
<name="daario"> Shut your mouth
<name="tyrion"> You can end this
<name="hizdahr"> She cannot
<name="tyrion"> You can
<name="daario"> Protect your queen
<name="hizdahr"> Your Grace, Your Grace, come with me! I know a way out! I know a way-
<name="tyrion"> Stay close
<name="jorah"> This way
<name="daario"> The other side, follow me
<name="daario"> Protect your queen
<name="daenerys"> Drogon

<name="aemon"> Egg! Egg I dreamed that I was old
<name="sam"> His name was Aemon Targaryen He came to us from King’s Landing, a Maester of the Citadel, chained and sworn And a sworn brother of the Night’s Watch, ever faithful No man was wiser or gentler or kinder At the Wall a dozen Lord Commanders came and went during his years of service, but he was always there to counsel them He was the blood of the dragon, but now his fire has gone out And now his watch has ended
<name="brothers"> And now his watch has ended

<name="sansa"> But isn’t your step mother pregnant?
<name="ramsay"> What of it?

<name="sansa"> But he’ll be the heir
<name="ramsay"> I’m Lord Bolton’s eldest son

<name="ramsay"> I’ve been naturalized by a royal decree of-
<name="sansa"> Tommen Baratheon Another bastard
<name="ramsay"> Bastards can rise high in the world Like your half-brother Jon Snow Born The Bastard of Winterfell, now the Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch

<name="davos"> We still have a hard march to Wintefell and we won’t be marching anywhere in this weather
<name="stannis"> And?
<name="davos"> This isn’t our time, we should head back to Castle Black when the snow clears
<name="stannis"> I retreated from King’s Landing, Ser Davos If I retreat again, I become ing Who Ran
<name="davos"> Your Grace
<name="stannis"> Winter is coming Those arent just the Stark words, it’s a fact If we march back to Castle Black, we winter at Castle Black And who can say how many years this winter will last
<name="davos"> It’s better to wait for the right time than to risk everything
<name="stannis"> This is the right time, and I will risk everything Because if I dont, we’ve lost We march to victory or we march to defeat, but we go forward only forward
<name="davos"> Your Grace
<name="stannis"> I’ve trusted in your visions, in your prophecies for years
<name="melisandre"> You saw it yourself, my king, when you stared into the flames A great battle in the snow
<name="stannis"> I don’t know what I saw

<name="melisandre"> But sometimes sacrifices must be made to ensure victory I have shown you the power of kings blood The Usurper Robb Stark The Usurper Joffrey Baratheon
<name="stannis"> We don’t have Robert’s bastard here

<name="brand"> Where are you going, huh? Aren’t we better looking than the fat man?
<name="derryk"> The question is, is she pretty down south in the real world, or is she pretty because she’s the only girl here?
<name="brand"> Even in White Harbor, I’d want a kiss
<name="derryk"> Come on love, give us a kiss
<name="gilly"> Leave me alone
<name="derryk"> If you were my girl I wouldn’t leave you alone
<name="brand"> One little kiss

<name="gilly"> I know they would have killed you if Ghost hadn’t come
<name="sam"> No They were tiring out I had them in the palm of my hand
<name="gilly"> Don’t be stupid Sam, you’re not a fighter
<name="sam"> What kind of man would I be if I ran away when I saw someone hurting you?
<name="gilly"> Just promise me that whatever happens you’ll take care of little Sam
<name="sam"> Of course I will And I’ll take care of you, too
<name="gilly"> I need more water

<name="gilly"> Am I hurting you?
<name="gilly"> Are you sure?
<name="sam"> Oh Oh my
<name="malko"> A rare find for the fighting pits, my friends Not your usual street tough old drunken pirate This one’s a Westerosi knight from an ancient house, trained in sword and lance he fought beside the Stag King Robert on the far side of the Narrow Sea He was first from the breach during the siege of Pyke, slaughtering 50 men with his flaming sword He killed the great Khal Drogo in single combat Betrayed by his woman, he sold himself into slavery to repay his debts Bidding begins at 12 gold honors
<name="malko"> 13 Do I have 14?
<name="malko"> 15? 15 golds honors Do I have 16?
<name="slave buyer"> 20
<name="malko"> Sold
<name="tyrion"> Wait! You have to buy me as well
<name="buyer"> Why?
<name="tyrion"> We’re a team I’m a great fighter, too
<name="malko"> He’s funny You have to give him that
<name="buyer"> Alright He’s funny
<name="tyrion"> Thank you my Lord Thank you
<name="buyer"> Yes
<name="tyrion"> My Lord, if I may I’ve heard Mereen’s become a free city You might run into trouble if you try to fight slaves in the fighting pits Now if you were to fight free men who were paid a wage
<name="buer"> Here’s your wages, funny man It’ll last the rest of your life
<name="daario"> How long before the king of Mereen comes to claim my pillow?
<name="daenerys"> Don’t be ridiculous My marriage to Hizdahr is political I think he’s smart enough to understand that
<name="daario"> I think the Sons of the Harpy have stopped killing because their leader was made king
<name="daenerys"> Are you jealous?
<name="daario"> Do you think I’m petty enough to speak ill of a man just because he represents competition?
<name="daenerys"> I do
<name="daario"> You’re right My motivations are entirely impure
<name="daario"> Doesn’t make me wrong
<name="daenerys"> You told me yourself, I can’t fight enemies within and without So when enemies from without come knocking, I need the city of Mereen behind me I have no choice
<name="daario"> Everyone has a choice Even slaves have a choice Death or slavery
<name="daenerys"> So what else can I do?
<name="daario"> Marry me instead
<name="daenerys"> Even if I wanted to do such an inadviseable thing, I couldn’t
<name="daario"> Why not? You’re our queen, you can do as you like
<name="daenerys"> No I can
<name="t daario"> Then you are the only person in Mereen who’s not free
<name="daario"> I know I’m here to serve my queen and not to give advice, but can I make one more suggestion?
<name="daenerys"> Of course
<name="daario"> On the day of the Great Games, gather all the great masters, and wise masters, and worthy masters you can find, and slaughter them all
<name="daenerys"> I am a queen Not a butcher
<name="daario"> All rulers are either butchers or meat
<name="olenna"> You there! Where would I find the High Septon, or High Sparrow, or whatever bloody fool name he’s got
<name="high sparrow"> It’s not as good a name as Queen of Thorns, I’ll admit
<name="olenna"> You should have the decency to stand when you talk to a lady
<name="sparrow"> You should have the decency to kneel before the gods
<name="olenna"> Don’t spar with me little fellow
<name="sparrow"> For me, it’s the knees You?
<name="olenna"> Hips
<name="sparrow"> Huh
<name="olenna"> A man of the people, is that your game? It’s an old game dull and unconvincing A man of the people who does Cersei’s dirty work for her
<name="sparrow"> The people always do the dirty work
<name="olenna"> Spare me the homilies, I can smell a fraud from a mile away
<name="sparrow"> A useful talent
<name="olenna"> I’m here for my grandson and granddaughter
<name="sparrow"> Your grandson and granddaughter swore sacred vows and lied The Father judges us all Sons of high lords, sons of fishermen If you break his laws you will be punished
<name="olenna"> Don’t you walk away from me
<name="sparrow"> You don’t give commands here, Lady Olenna
<name="olenna"> What is it you want? Gold? I’ll make you the richest septon who ever lived
<name="olenna"> What then?
<name="sparrow"> I imagine this is strange for you Everyone you meet has a hidden motive, and you pride yourself on slitting in and out But I’m telling you a simple truth I serve the gods The gods demand justice
<name="olenna"> How do they communicate their demands? By raven or horse?
<name="sparrow"> By the holy text The seven pointed star If you don’t have one in your library I’ll give you my own
<name="olenna"> I’ve read the seven pointed star
<name="sparrow"> Then you’ll remember the passages concerning buggery and perjury Your grandchildren will be punished in the same manner as anyone who breaks the sacred laws
<name="olenna"> Half the men, women, and children in this foul city break the sacred laws You live among murderers, thieves, and rapists And yet you punish Loras for shagging and Margaery for defending her brother?
<name="sparrow"> Yes The Gods’ laws must be applied to all equally
<name="olenna"> If it’s equality you want then so be it When House Tyrell stops sending our crops to the capital, everyone here will starve And I’ll make sure the hungry know who to blame
<name="sparrow"> Have you ever served the field, Lady Olenna? Have you ever reaped the grain? Has anyone in House Tyrell? A lifetime of wealth and power has left you blind in one eye You are the few We are the many And when the many stop fearing the few
<name="squire"> Lady Olenna
<name="cersei"> Starving yourself wont make things any better for her, my love
<name="tommen"> She’s in a prison cell and there’s nothing I can do I am the king! The queen is in prison and there’s nothing I can do
<name="cersei"> No matter who you are, no matter how strong you are, sooner or later, youll face circumstances beyond your control Events you couldnt possibly have anticipated or prevented even if you had You cannot blame yourself for fate Your father, your brother, your grandfather I was Queen of the Seven Kingdoms and what could I do? Hold them as they left this world Kissed their heads after theyd gone
<name="tommen"> I’ll call in the army I’ll take back the sept and kill every last one of them I’ll start a war if I have to
<name="cersei"> You know as well as I do who the first casualty in that war would be
<name="tommen"> I love her I love her I can’t help her
<name="cersei"> We must be strong for those we love We cannot give in to despair
<name="tommen"> I will speak to the high sparrow There must be something-
<name="cersei"> Let me speak to him on your behalf The king cannot dirty sully himself negotiating with an unwashed fanatic
<name="cersei"> Your happiness is all I want in this world
<name="tommen"> I know
<name="cersei"> No you don’t You can’t possibly Not until you have children of your own I would do anything for you Anything to keep you from harm I would burn cities to the ground That is all that matters You and your sister From the moment you came into this world, my boy My only boy
<name="areo"> Prince Doran hopes this satisfies your concerns about the princess’s wellbeing
<name="myrcella"> You looked different when I left You had more hair
<name="jaime"> And more hands How’s Trystane?
<name="myrcella"> He’ll be alright
<name="jaime"> I’m sorry for that It wasn’t supposed to happen that way
<name="myrcella"> Why is it happening at all?
<name="jaime"> Your mother’s worried about you Threats have been made Dorne is too dangerous for you I’ve come to take you home
<name="myrcella"> This is my home, this has been my home for years I didn’t want to come here but she told me to I did what she said, I did my duty and now she’s forcing me to go back?
<name="jaime"> Its for your own good These are complicated matters
<name="myrcella"> It’s not complicated at all, it’s simple I love Trystane, I’m going to marry him, and we’re staying right here
<name="jaime"> I don’t understand
<name="myrcella"> Of course you don’t! You don’t know me
<name="bronn"> Brothers oh brothers, my days here are done, the Dornishman’s taken my life Bur what does it matter, for all men must die, and I’ve tasted the Dornishman’s wife! Yes I’ve tasted the Dornishman’s wife
<name="tyene"> He’s got a good voice
<name="obara"> We’re lucky he’s a singer If he were a fighter we might have been in trouble
<name="bronn"> It’s against my code to hurt a woman
<name="obara"> It’s amazing how many men we beat seem to have this code
<name="bronn"> I wouldn’t say you beat me
<name="tyene"> How’s your arm?
<name="bronn"> Wonderful Wouldn’t feel right to leave Dorne without a new scar
<name="tyene"> You think you’re leaving Dorne?
<name="bronn"> No great hurry Dornish women are the most beautiful women in the world
<name="tyene"> Thank you
<name="bronn"> I said Dornish women I didn’t say you
<name="tyene"> I’m not the most beautiful woman you’ve ever seen?
<name="bronn"> I’ve seen quite a few women in all the Seven Kingdoms
<name="tyene"> Name one more beautiful than I am
<name="bronn"> Well now, in King’s Landing there was an absolutely gorgeous.
<name="tyene"> There was a what? In King’s Landing you were saying
<name="bronn"> Was I?
<name="tyene"> There was a woman more beautiful than I am
<name="bronn"> Was there? My memory’s not what it was earlier
<name="tyene"> How’s your arm now?
<name="bronn"> You seem concerned with it You must really like me
<name="tyene"> And how about your head?
<name="bronn"> My head You don’t even wanna know what’s going on in
<name="tyene"> Your nose is bleeding
<name="bronn"> It’s nothing It’s the dry air
<name="tyene"> My dagger was coated with a special ointment from Asshei They call it the Long Farewell It takes time to work, but if a single drop makes contact with the skin, death
<name="tyene"> The only antidote Who’s the most beautiful woman in the world?
<name="tyene"> Sorry? Who?
<name="bronn"> You
<name="tyene"> Don’t drop it
<name="tyene"> I think you’re very handsome as well
<name="littlefinger"> I’m sorry about the locale
<name="olenna"> No you’re not
<name="littlefinger"> It felt like the safest place
<name="olenna"> Not for your clientele, clearly
<name="littlefinger"> It was an establishment like no other The sheer range of appetites catered to, desires that didn’t exist until we invented them
<name="olenna"> You’ve always been rather impressed with yourself, haven’t you?
<name="littlefinger"> The past is the past The future is all that’s worth discussing The future of House Tyrell
<name="olenna"> Don’t pretend to have any concern for my house, my grandchildren, or me I should have known you’d return to the capital once things started going wrong
<name="littlefinger"> I promise you
<name="olenna"> I promise you, Lord Baelish, that our fates are joined Together we murdered a king And if my house should fall, I would have nothing to hide And if i should meet with some accident here at this broken little flesh market, they’ll never even find what’s left of you So do you deny a part in all of this?
<name="littlefinger"> Cersei summoned me to King’s Landing I dared not refuse her
<name="olenna"> And what did she want?
<name="littlefinger"> A piece of info that she know that I had Neither silence nor lies were an option But I have other information of which she is unaware And as you say, our interests are aligned I have a gift for you
<name="olenna"> What kind of gift?
<name="littlefinger"> The same kind I gave Cersei A handsome young man
<name="slave owner"> Many worthy fighters have died trying to make it to the Great Games When most of you worthless scum join them in death this afternoon it will represent a significant rise in your station But if you happen to triumph here you will fight at the great pit of Daznak itself in front of the queen So whatever happens, the gods have smiled upon you today Today is the day your lives actually start to mean something
<name="owner"> You and you, you, you two, you, you, and you
<name="owner"> Valar morghulis
<name="men"> Valar dohaeris
<name="owner"> Prepare yourselves
<name="daenerys"> Sitting through the great games will be bad enough
<name="hizdahr"> For generations, in the days leading up to the great games, it has been customary for our ruler to make the rounds to the lower pits to pay the fighters there the honor of her presence
<name="owner"> Move yourselves
<name="owner"> Your Grace Your Future Grace You honor us all
<name="owner"> We fight and die for your glory, O glorious queen
<name="men"> We fight and die for your glory, O glorious queen
<name="daenerys"> I think I’ve seen enough
<name="hizdahr"> Your Grace, it’s a tradition for the queen to stay until the victor has emerged
<name="daenerys"> I’ve sacrificed more than enough for your traditions
<name="tyrion"> What are you doing?
<name="daenerys"> Get him out of my sight
<name="jorah"> Khaleesi, please, I just need a moment of your time I brought you a gift
<name="tyrion"> It’s true He has
<name="daenerys"> Who are you?
<name="tyrion"> I am the gift It’s a pleasure to meet you, Your Grace My name is Tyrion Lannister
<name="cersei"> This is horrible Unacceptable Are they feeding you enough at least? I brought you this Venison It’s quite good I had it myself for supper only last night We did everything we could from the moment they took your brother Tommen even went to the sept himself to confront the high sparrow, but I fear The Faith has left reason behind
<name="margaery"> I know you did this
<name="cersei"> We are making every effort on your behalf I swear to you by all the seven gods
<name="margaery"> Lies come easily to you Everyone knows that But innocence, decency, concern? You’re not very good at those, I’m afraid Perhaps that’s why your son was so eager to cast you aside for me
<name="cersei"> You’re upset You’re not thinking clearly I’ll visit again when you’ve had a chance to calm down
<name="margaery"> I don’t want to see you again
<name="cersei"> I do hope you change your mind about that I’ve been told men often go mad in the Black Cells below the Red Keep, but I suppose your isolation will end once your trial begins
<name="margaery"> Leave
<name="cersei"> Yes, I’m afraid I must My son needs me now more than ever
<name="medicine margaery"> Get out you hateful bitch
<name="cersei"> Sleep well, sister
<name="high sparrow"> Thank you You saw her?
<name="cersei"> Yes
<name="sparrow"> And?
<name="cersei"> Her accommodations seem sufficient What happens to her now?
<name="sparrow"> Well she and her brother are both being held under fair suspicion A trial will be held for each of them to determine if they are guilty of any acts that might constitute a violation of the tenants of the faith
<name="cersei"> Who will stand judge?
<name="sparrow"> Seven septons As it was in all trials before the Targaryens
<name="cersei"> Will you be one of them?
<name="sparrow"> I will
<name="cersei"> If one or both of them were to confess before the trial
<name="sparrow"> Then they will be at The Mother’s mercy
<name="cersei"> What does The Mother’s mercy entail?
<name="sparrow"> It depends on the situation The acts themselves, the degree of contrition
<name="cersei"> Thank you High Septon for bringing them whatever justice they deserve in the eyes of the Seven
<name="sparrow"> Did you know this chapel is one of the oldest structures in King’s Landing?
<name="cersei"> I think I may have heard at one point
<name="sparrow"> Baelor built his sept around it But men worshipped here long before him
<name="sparrow"> Who carved this altar do you know?
<name="cersei"> I’m afraid i don’t
<name="sparrow"> No one does There’s no name on it Or anywhere else in the chapel The people who built this place didn’t inflict their vanity on the people who came after them The way Baelor did with that great gilded monstrosity out there Their faith was clean Strip away the gold and the ornaments, knock down the statues and the pillars, and this is what remains Something simple, solid, and true The Tyrell’s finery will be stripped away Their lives knocked down, their true hearts laid bare for all to see And so it will be for all of us, high and low alike What will we find when we strip away your finery?
<name="sparrow"> A young man came to us not long ago, broken in body and spirit He had so much to strip away, so much weighing him down But piece by piece he unburdened himself Let go of vanity, pride, sin, now his soul is so light he will float through the Seven Heaves like a bird
<name="sparrow"> And he has much to say about you
<name="cersei"> Move Let me go immediately
<name="cersei"> You will order her to let me go! I am the queen! I am the queen! Have you lost your mind? Let me go! You filthy I am the queen! Let me go

<name="waitress"> Ale? Ale?
<name="sansa"> Before we left, a maester gave you a raven scroll
<name="littlefinger"> You are becoming an observant young lady
<name="sansa"> My mother used to say, dark wings, dark words
<name="littlefinger"> An old saying Inaccurate in this case
<name="sansa"> So it was good news.?
<name="littlefinger"> My marriage proposal has been accepted
<name="sansa"> I thought you still mourn the death of my beloved Aunt Lysa
<name="waitress"> Ale?
<name="sansa"> Ill have some
<name="podrick"> My lady
<name="brienne"> What is it?
<name="podrick"> Sansa Stark Dont look
<name="brienne"> You sure?
<name="podrick"> Shes dyed her hair, but its her Shes sitting with Petyr Baelish
<name="brienne"> Littlefinger?
<name="podrick"> A bunch of knights with him BRIENNE Bunch? Whats a bunch? 100? 6? 20?
<name="podrick"> 10, I think Too many My lady, I dont think this is the right-
<name="brienne"> Ready the horses
<name="podrick"> We only have one horse
<name="brienne"> Find more
<name="littlefinger"> Do you like the taste?
<name="sansa"> I dont see what all the fuss is about Why do men love it so much?
<name="littlefinger"> It gives some men courage
<name="sansa"> Does it give you courage?
<name="guard"> Thats far enough
<name="brienne"> Lord Baelish, Lady Sansa, my name is Brienne of Tarth
<name="littlefinger"> Weve met With Renly Baratheon What did he say about you? He said, Youre a loyalty comes free of charge Someone appears to have paid quite a bit for it since then
<name="brienne"> Lady Sansa, before your mothers death, I was her sworn sword I gave my word I would find you and protect you I will shield your back and keep your council, and give my life for yours if need be I swear it by the old gods and the new
<name="littlefinger"> Please, Lady Brienne No need for such formality You are Catelyn Starks sworn sword?
<name="brienne"> I was
<name="littlefinger"> Strange I knew Cat from the time we were children She never mentioned you
<name="brienne"> It was after Renlys murder
<name="littlefinger"> Ah, yes You were accused of killing him
<name="brienne"> I tried to save him
<name="littlefinger"> But you were accused
<name="brienne"> By men who didnt see what happened
<name="littlefinger"> Then what did happen?
<name="brienne"> He was murdered by a shadow A shadow with a face of Stannis Baratheon
<name="littlefinger"> A shadow? With a face? This woman swore to protect Renly; she failed She swore to protect your mother; she failed Why would I want somebody with your history of failure guiding Lady Sansa?
<name="brienne"> Why should you have any say in her affairs?
<name="littlefinger"> Because I am her uncle I married her Aunt Lysa shortly before my beloved’s untimely death Were family now, and youre an outsider Forgive me, Lady Brienne, but experiences made me wary of outsiders
<name="brienne"> Lady Sansa, if we can have a word alone-
<name="sansa"> No
<name="brienne"> Please, my lady If I could explain-
<name="sansa"> I saw you at Joffreys wedding bowing to the king
<name="brienne"> Neither of us wanted to be there Sometimes we dont have a choice
<name="sansa"> And sometimes we do You should leave
<name="littlefinger"> We dont want our new friend wandering the countryside alone The roads of these parts arent safe Why dont you stay?
<name="knight"> He asked you to stay
<name="guard"> After her
<name="brienne"> Podrick
<name="podrick"> Stop, stop, stop! That’s a good boy
<name="knight"> I guess that means you’re unarmed
<name="brienne"> Down, Podrick, down
<name="brienne"> Podrick?
<name="podrick"> Yes, my lady?
<name="brienne"> You can stand now
<name="podrick"> Yes, my lady Sansa Stark?
<name="brienne"> Wary of strangers, as she should me I saw her riding on the East Trail with Littlefinger We’ll follow them
<name="podrick"> My lady, if those Stark girls refused your service, maybe you’re released from your vow
<name="brienne"> I swore to their mother I’d protect those girls
<name="podrick"> If they don’t want your protection-
<name="brienne"> Do you think she’s safe from Littlefinger?
<name="podrick"> No, my lady
<name="brienne"> Get your horse
<name="jaime"> A summons from the queen
<name="cersei"> There are only two like it in the world the one I’m wearing and the one I gave to Myrcella
<name="jaime"> It’s a threat
<name="cersei"> Of course it’s a threat! Our daughter’s in Dorne surrounded by people who hate our family Its a threat
<name="jaime"> No note
<name="cersei"> They blame us for the death of Oberyn and his sister, and every other tragedy that’s befallen their cursed country I will burn their cities to the ground if they touch her
<name="jaime"> Softer
<name="cersei"> What?
<name="jaime"> Not so loud
<name="cersei"> Our daughter’s in danger, and you’re worried I’m speaking too loudly
<name="jaime"> The world cant know knows she’s our daughter
<name="cersei"> Then don’t call her your daughter You’ve never been a father to her
<name="jaime"> If I was the father to any of my children, they’d be stoned in the streets
<name="cersei"> And what has your caution brought? Our eldest child murdered at his own wedding Our only daughter shipped off to Dorne Our baby boy sent to marry that smirking whore from Highgarden
<name="jaime"> I’ll make things better
<name="cersei"> You never made anything better
<name="jaime"> I’m going to Dorne I’ll bring our daughter home
<name="cersei"> You can’t just ask Prince Doran to give her back! She’s promised his son
<name="jaime"> I’m not going to ask him anything
<name="cersei"> You go there with an army, it’s an act of war
<name="jaime"> No army Do you know where they’re keeping her?
<name="cersei"> Oberyn mentioned the Water Gardens
<name="jaime"> I’ll find her Is there anything else, your grace?
<name="cersei"> You’re going to Dorne? A one-handed man? Alone?
<name="jaime"> I never said I was going alone
<name="lollys stokeworth"> No sunflowers I dont like yellow Roses are very nice, definitely roses And music I adore music But no flutes, I hate flutes! We can have a harp if you like, but no flutes Then theres the food Food is the most important thing, dont you agree? Were going to need pigeon pies Thats what they eat in the capital, dont they?
<name="lollys"> Dont they?
<name="bronn"> Dont who?
<name="lollys"> People eat pigeon pie in the capital
<name="bronn"> They certainly do, my dear They certainly do
<name="bronn"> Its a fine place, isnt it? A fine place I never thought Id end up settling down in a place like this
<name="lollys"> You wont
<name="bronn"> Pardon?
<name="lollys"> We wont get to live at Stokeworth When Mother dies, my sister gets the castle because shes older
<name="bronn"> Oh
<name="lollys"> She hates me She calls me mean names, and sometimes even still she pulls my hair when Mother isnt looking
<name="bronn"> You know what I think? I think youre a good person And your sister is a mean person
<name="lollys"> She is
<name="bronn"> Ive been all over the world And if theres one thing Ive learned, its that meanness comes around People like your sister, they always get whats coming to them eventually One way or another
<name="lollys"> Whos that?
<name="bronn"> Jaime fucking Lannister
<name="bronn"> Ser Jaime
<name="jaime"> Ser Bronn of the Blackwater
<name="bronn"> I was very sorry to hear about your father
<name="jaime"> Thank you
<name="bronn"> This is my betrothed, Lollys
<name="jaime"> A pleasure
<name="bronn"> Run along, love
<name="jaime"> Beautiful bride youve chosen When were you planning on getting married?
<name="bronn"> Just get on with it
<name="jaime"> On with what?
<name="bronn"> What youre here for Theres no way this little visit could possibly mean anything good for me
<name="jaime"> Its very good for you
<name="bronn"> Lollys will be marrying Ser Wyllis Bracken
<name="jaime"> Mmm
<name="bronn"> We made a deal, your sister and I
<name="jaime"> I would have advised against that
<name="bronn"> How is this good for me?
<name="jaime"> Cause youre going to come with me and help me with something important And when we return, Im going to give you a much better girl, and a much better castle
<name="bronn"> Return from where?
<name="jaime"> As far south as south goes
<name="trystane"> My future queen
<name="areo"> The prince does not wish to be disturbed
<name="ellaria"> Remove myself from my path, or Ill take that long axe and shove it-
<name="doran"> Captain Let her pass
<name="ellaria"> Your brother was murdered, and you sit here at the Water Gardens, staring at the sky and doing nothing
<name="doran"> Oberyn was slain during a trial by combat By law, that is not murder
<name="ellaria"> Your brother-
<name="doran"> You dont have to remind me He was my brother long before he was anything to you
<name="ellaria"> What will you do about his death
<name="doran"> I will bury him I will mourn for him
<name="ellaria"> You would have me go to war?
<name="doran"> You would have me go to war?
<name="ellaria"> The whole country would have you go to war
<name="doran"> Then we are lucky the whole country does not decide
<name="ellaria"> The Sand Snakes are with me They have the love of their people They will avenge your father while you sit here in your chair doing nothing
<name="ellaria"> Oberyn is dead And this Lannister girl skips about the Water Gardens eating our food, breathing our air How many of your brothers and sisters do they have to kill? Let me have her Let me send her to Cersei one finger at a time
<name="doran"> I loved my brother And you made him very happy For that you will always have a place in my heart But we do not mutilate little girls for vengeance Not here Not while I rule
<name="ellaria"> And how long will that be?
<name="daario"> The Unsullied are too conspicuous
<name="daario"> Anyone can see you coming from a mile off Of course you havent found any Sons of the Harpy You havent, have you?
<name="daario"> My Second Sons, on the other hand, they drink, they whore, fight in the streets they blend in They overhear things in taverns, follow people from the taverns to nice, quiet alleys, break a few fingers, overhear a few more things Before you know it.
<name="grey worm"> No one here We go
<name="daario"> In a hurry? Youre afraid?
<name="grey worm"> Unsullied fear nothing
<name="daario"> Right Thats your problem You understood fear once, long ago, but youve forgotten what it means Someone whos forgotten fear has forgotten how to hide
<name="daario"> Fear is useful that way
<name="mossador"> Sons of the Harpy, they want to put a collar back on my neck On all of our necks Please, Your Grace, you must kill him
<name="daenerys"> It would send a message
<name="barristan"> I think you should exercise restraint, Your Grace
<name="daenerys"> Why?
<name="barristan"> For one thing, he may have valuable information
<name="daario"> The Son of the Harpy has no more valuable information
<name="barristan"> How do you know that?
<name="daario"> Because I questioned him
<name="hizdahr"> And the information you did get, he is young and poor
<name="mossador"> He is born free
<name="hizdahr"> Why should he want to bring back slavery? What did it do for him?
<name="daenerys"> Perhaps the only thing that gave him pride was knowing that there was someone lower than he was
<name="mossador"> They pay him Great families afraid to do a thing They pay poor man to do it for them
<name="hizdahr"> And how do you know this?
<name="mossador"> Everyone knows this
<name="hizdahr"> I dont know it, and Im the head of a great family
<name="barristan"> We do not know what this man did or didnt do Give him a trial, at least A fair trial Show all of the citizens of Meereen that you are better than those who would depose Teach them a better way
<name="mossador"> I do not know the place from where Old Ser comes Things maybe are different there, I hope But here, in Meereen, before Daenerys Stormborn, they own us So we learn much about them or we do not live long They teach me what they are Mercy
<name="fair trial"> these mean nothing to them All they understand is blood
<name="daenerys"> Thank you all for your counsel
<name="barristan"> Your Grace, a word, please, I beg you
<name="daenerys"> About what?
<name="barristan"> About your father About the Mad King
<name="daenerys"> The Mad King? Youre here to remind me of my enemies lies? Consider me reminded
<name="barristan"> Your Grace, I served in his Kingsguard I was at his side from the first Your enemies did not lie
<name="daenerys"> Go on
<name="barristan"> When the people rose in revolt against him, your father set their towns and castles aflame He murdered sons in front of their fathers He burned men alive with Wildfire, and laughed as they screamed And his efforts to stamp out dissent led to rebellion that killed every Targaryen except two
<name="daenerys"> Im not my father
<name="barristan"> No, Your Grace Thank the gods But the Mad King gave his enemies the justice he thought they deserved And each time it made him feel powerful and right Until the very end
<name="daenerys"> I will not have the Son of the Harpy executed without a fair trial
<name="barristan"> Your Grace
<name="tyrion"> Theres a bug
<name="varys"> Yes, best be careful You might accidentally consume some solid food
<name="tyrion"> When I agreed to come with you, did I misrepresent my intentions? Besides, what is there for me to do inside this fucking box?
<name="varys"> You dont like it?
<name="tyrion"> I want to take a walk
<name="varys"> You cant Cersei has offered a lordship to the man who brings her your head
<name="tyrion"> She ought to offer her cunt Best part of her for the best part of me Well, I suppose a box is as good a place for me as anywhere
<name="varys"> Are we really going to spend the entire road to Volantis talking about the futility of everything?
<name="tyrion"> Youre right No point The road to Volantis? You said we were going to Meereen Whats in Volantis?
<name="varys"> The road to Meereen
<name="tyrion"> And what do you hope to find at the end of the road to Meereen?
<name="varys"> I told you A ruler
<name="tyrion"> Weve already got a ruler Everywhere has already got a ruler Every pile of shit on the side of every road has someones banner hanging from it
<name="varys"> You were quite good, you know At ruling During your brief tenure as Hand
<name="tyrion"> I didnt rule I was a servant
<name="varys"> Still, a man of talent
<name="tyrion"> Managed to kill a lot of people
<name="varys"> Yes, but showed great promise in other areas as well
<name="tyrion"> She wanted me to leave Kings Landing She begged me I wouldnt go
<name="varys"> Why?
<name="tyrion"> Cause I liked it Power Even as a servant
<name="varys"> People follow leaders And they will never follow us They find us repulsive
<name="tyrion"> I find us repulsive
<name="varys"> And we find them repulsive, which is why we surround ourselves with large, comfortable boxes to keep them away And yet, no matter what we do, people like you and me are never really satisfied inside the box Not for long
<name="tyrion"> Youre right Lets go for a walk
<name="varys"> No
<name="tyrion"> How many dwarves are there in the world? Is Cersei going to kill them all?
<name="cersei"> Not him
<name="meryn"> Are you trying to deceive your Queen? Shall I throw them in a cell, Your Grace?
<name="cersei"> That wont be necessary, I dont want to dissuade the other hunters Mistakes will be made
<name="hunters"> Thank you, Your Grace Thank you
<name="cersei"> Take the head
<name="qyburn"> Pardon me, Your Grace I would take it, if you dont mind It could prove useful for my work
<name="cersei"> Very good
<name="qyburn"> Over there will be fine
<name="meryn"> You heard the man Over there
<name="kevan"> Youre the Hand of the King?
<name="cersei"> No, Uncle Clearly it would not be appropriate for a woman to assume that role Im merely advising my son until he comes of age and chooses a Hand for himself
<name="mace"> Your Grace, I would be willing to serve provisionally as the Kings Hand until he becomes old enough-
<name="cersei"> Youre a good man, Lord Tyrell, but I dont imagine youll have the time In addition to being Master of Ships, the king has appointed you Master of Coin
<name="mace"> Oh, Your Grace
<name="cersei"> He called your experience and wisdom in financial matters unparalleled He said he would be honored to have you represent the crowns interests in the same
<name="mace"> The honor is all mine, Your Grace
<name="pycelle"> Your Grace, in the past on several occasions, a Grand Maester has served as the Kings Hand
<name="cersei"> ing has named Qyburn the new Master of Whisperers
<name="pycelle"> Your Grace, him? This man? This embarrassment to the Citadel? Your Grace, what qualifications can he possibly have for this post?
<name="cersei"> The qualification of loyalty, Grand Maester Thats far more than the eunuch ever had Far more than many ever have
<name="pycelle"> I must say I cannot see-
<name="cersei"> Uncle Kevan, in light of your position as commander of the Lannister armies, it would please the king if you would serve as his Master of War No man living better deserves the title
<name="kevan"> That is kind of you to say I would like to hear it from the king himself
<name="cersei"> The king is very busy at this moment
<name="kevan"> He should be here, learning what it means to rule
<name="cersei"> He is learning On this occasion, in his capacity as ruler, hes asked me to speak on his behalf
<name="kevan"> I returned to the capital to pay my respects to my brother And to you And to serve the king I did not return to the capital to serve as your puppet To watch you stack the small council with sycophants Sending your own brother away so he wouldnt be-
<name="cersei"> My brother has left the capital to lead a sensitive diplomatic mission
<name="kevan"> What mission?
<name="cersei"> That is not your concern as Master of War
<name="kevan"> I do not recognize your authority to dictate what is and is not my concern You are the Queen Mother Nothing more
<name="cersei"> You would abandon your king in his time of need?
<name="kevan"> If he wants to send for me, I will be waiting for him At Casterly Rock
<name="shireen"> Come on You know this one It looks like an animal
<name="gilly"> Snake Snake S! Its an S
<name="shireen"> Right, very good
<name="sam"> Hmm! Did you know that the youngest Lord Commander in history, Osric Stark, was elected at the age of 10?
<name="gilly"> I know S
<name="shireen"> Youll learn, I promise I taught Ser Davos, and old people are terrible at learning new things
<name="gilly"> Well, youre a wonderful teacher Very patient
<name="sam"> I only said that the more time you spend practicing, the faster youll be able to read
<name="gilly"> Thats alright Were doing just fine Im sure you and Ostrich Stark have a lot to talk about
<name="gilly"> How old were you when you learned to read?
<name="shireen"> Three
<name="sam"> Three?! Who taught you, your mother?
<name="shireen"> No Old Maester Cressen did I had a lot of time to practice My mother kept me inside because.
<name="gilly"> What do you call it in the South, what happened to your face?
<name="shireen"> Greyscale What do you call it north of the Wall?
<name="gilly"> I dont know But two of my sisters had it They both died How did they cure you?
<name="shireen"> I dont remember I was a baby Lots of people came and tried, I think Whatever they did, it went away What happened to your sisters?
<name="gilly"> My father made them move out of the keep into the huts outside None of us were allowed to go near them But we heard them Especially at night They started to sound not like themselves
<name="sam"> Did you ever see them?
<name="gilly"> Only once at the end They were covered with it Their faces, their arms They acted like animals My father had to drag them out to the woods on a rope
<name="shireen"> What did he do to them in the woods?
<name="shireen"> Mother
<name="selyse"> Leave us
<name="sam"> Your Grace
<name="selyse"> You need to stay away from that girl
<name="shireen"> Why?
<name="selyse"> Shes a wildling
<name="shireen"> Her names Gilly Shes nice Im teaching her to read
<name="selyse"> Shes a wildling Your father defeated their people He executed her king for treason They could strike at him by striking at you
<name="shireen"> Gilly wouldnt do that
<name="selyse"> You have no idea what people will do All your books and you still dont know
<name="stannis"> I ordered Mance Rayder burnt at the stake You prevented that order from being carried out You showed mercy to Mance Rayder A kings word is law Perhaps you should ask Ser Davos how much mercy I show to lawbreakers Show too much kindness, people wont fear you If people dont fear you, they dont follow you
<name="jon"> With respect, Your Grace, the free folk will never follow you, no matter what you do Youre the man who burned their king alive
<name="stannis"> Who then? You?
<name="jon"> No Only one of their own
<name="stannis"> Do you know this wretched girl Lyanna Mormont?
<name="jon"> The Lord Commanders niece
<name="stannis"> Lady of Bear Island, and a child of 10 I asked her to commit her house to my cause, thats her response
<name="jon"> Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North, whose name is Stark
<name="stannis"> That amuses you?
<name="jon"> I apologize, Your Grace Northerners can be a bit like the free folk Loyal to their own
<name="stannis"> I know My brother Robert went on often and loudly about how difficult it was to control them even with your fathers help
<name="davos"> Tonight, the Nights Watch elect a new Lord Commander Ser Alliser Thorne is going to win
<name="jon"> Most likely
<name="davos"> Unpleasant man He thinks youre a traitor Whats your life going to be like on the Wall with Thorne in command?
<name="jon"> Unpleasant, I expect
<name="stannis"> Your bravery made him look weak Hell punish you for it I dont punish men for bravery I reward them
<name="jon"> I dont doubt it, Your Grace But Im a brother of the Nights Watch Ive pledged them my life, my honor, my sword I dont know what I have left to give you
<name="stannis"> You can give me the North
<name="jon"> I cant Even if I wanted to, Im a bastard A Snow
<name="stannis"> Kneel before me Lay your sword at my feet Pledge me your service and youll rise again as Jon Stark, Lord of Winterfell
<name="sam"> Hell make you a Stark with the stroke of a pen?
<name="jon"> Its the first thing I ever remember wanting Id daydream that my father would ask the king, and just like that I would never be the bastard of Winterfell again
<name="sam"> You deserve this You do I couldnt be happier for you
<name="jon"> Im going to refuse him
<name="sam"> But youd be Lord of Winterfell
<name="jon"> I swore a vow to the Nights Watch If I dont take my own word seriously, what sort of Lord of Winterfell would I be?
<name="alliser"> Crowded Youd think we were serving venison stew
<name="aemon"> Does anyone wish to speak for candidates before we cast our tokens for the 998th Lord Commander of the Nights Watch?
<name="janos"> Ser Alliser Thorne is not just a knight, hes a man of true nobility He was acting commander when the Wall came under attack, and led us to victory against the wildlings
<name="men"> Hear, hear
<name="janos"> Hes a veteran of 100 battles and has been a defender of the Watch and the Wall almost all of his life Hes the only true choice
<name="aemon"> Is there anyone else?
<name="shadow tower brother"> Ser Denys Mallister joined the Watch as a boy and has served loyally longer than any other ranger Through 10 winters he served As commander of the Shadow Tower, he kept the wildlings away We could do no better
<name="aemon"> If theres no one else, we will begin the voting The triangular tokens count for Ser Alliser Thorne The square tokens for Ser Denys Mallister Each brother will-
<name="sam"> Maester Aemon
<name="aemon"> Samwell Tarly Go on
<name="janos"> Sam the Slayer
<name="janos"> Another wildling lover just like his friend Jon Snow Hows your lady love Slayer?
<name="sam"> Her name is Gilly Brother Slynt knows her quite well They cowered together in the larder during the battle for the Wall
<name="janos"> Lies
<name="sam"> A wildling girl, a baby, and Lord Janos I found him there when the battle was over in a puddle of his own making
<name="sam"> Whilst Lord Janos was hiding with the women and children, Jon Snow was leading
<name="sam"> Ser Alliser fought bravely, it is true And when he was wounded, it is Jon who saved us He took charge of the walls defense He killed the Magnar of the Thenns He went North to deal with Mance Rayder, knowing it almost certainly meant his own death Before that, he led the mission to avenge Lord Commander Mormont Mormont himself chose Jon to be his steward He saw something in Jon, and now weve all seen it, too He may be young, but hes the commander we turned to when the night was darkest
<name="alliser"> I cant argue with any of that But who does Jon Snow want to command? Nights Watch or the wildlings? Everyone knows he loved a wildling girl and spoke with Mance Rayder many times What would have happened in that tent between those two old friends if Stanniss army hadnt come along? We all saw him put the King-beyond-the-Wall out of his misery Do you want to choose a man who has fought the wildlings all his life, or a man who makes love to them?
<name="aemon"> It is time
<name="brother"> It appears to be a tie, Maester
<name="brothers"> Jon Snow! Jon Snow! Jon Snow! Jon Snow
<name="man"> You You
<name="man"> What have you got there?
<name="man"> I said-
<name="arya"> Turn around and go Turn around and go
<name="man"> Thats a nice little sword Worth 100 pieces, a sword like that
<name="arya"> Nothings worth anything to dead men
<name="men"> Quickly, go, go
<name="arya"> Who are you? Why were they scared of you?
<name="old man"> You lost this
<name="arya"> You said there was no Jaqen Hghar here
<name="jaqen"> There isnt A man is not Jaqen Hghar
<name="arya"> Well who are you then?
<name="jaqen"> No one And that is who a girl must become
<name="harpy"> She doesnt belong here And no matter how many of your traitors call her Mhysa , she will never be your mother
<name="daenerys"> Why?
<name="mossador"> For you, Mhysa You wanted the Harpy dead, but your hands were tied I set you free, as you did all of us
<name="daenerys"> He was our prisoner, awaiting trial You had no right
<name="mossador"> He would rather rip your city apart than see slaves lifted from the dirt
<name="daenerys"> There are no more slaves There are no more Masters
<name="mossador"> Then who lives in the Pyramids? Who wears gold masks and murders your children? When Grey Worm came to us, I was the first to take up the knife for you I remember the look on my fathers face as I struck down his Master, who had traded his infant son for a dog My father died in the fighting If we allow the Sons of the Harpy to return us to chains, he never lived
<name="daenerys"> The Harpys life was not yours to take Once, the Masters were the law-
<name="mosador"> and now you are the law
<name="daenerys"> The law is the law Take him
<name="crowd"> Mhysa! Myhsa
<name="hizdahr"> She should have cut off the traitors head in the Great Pyramid and been done with it
<name="daario"> Which is what I keep telling her to do to you
<name="daenerys"> You opened your gates to me because I promised you freedom and justice One cannot exist without the other
<name="crowd"> Brother! Brother
<name="mossador"> Mhysa, please! Forgive me
<name="daenerys"> A citizen of Meereen was awaiting trial and this man murdered him The punishment is death
<name="crowd"> Mercy! Mercy
<name="mossador"> Mhysa.
<name="crowd"> Mhysa.
<name="barristan"> Ill stand guard outside your door tonight, Your Grace
<name="grey worm"> We all guard tonight
<name="daenerys"> Leave me

<name="cersei"> Will the king and I have children?
<name="maggy"> No The king will have 20 children, and you will have 3

<name="priest"> Your grace, we are honored by your presence The mourners are waiting
<name="cersei"> They will keep waiting I want a moment alone with him
<name="priest"> But your grace, many of these lords and ladies have travelled day and night to be here
<name="priest"> From all seven kingdoms
<name="cersei"> They will wait
<name="cersei"> He never wanted you to be a King’s Guard, but here you are, protecting his dead body
<name="jaime"> What he built The towers He built it for us He meant it for us They’re going to try to take it away, all of it
<name="cersei"> They?
<name="jaime"> All of them out there are enemies They’re waiting a night to make sure he’s really dead and as soon as they see the stones on his eyes they’ll set to work on tearing us apart
<name="cersei"> They had nothing to do with it The man who murdered our father, he tore us apart, he’s the enemy I’ve been telling you for years, you’ve been defending him for years
<name="jaime"> This is exactly what they want
<name="cersei"> and now our father is dead And that little monster is out there somewhere drawing breath Did you set him free?
<name="cersei"> Tyrion may be a monster but at least he killed our father on purpose You killed him by mistake With stupidity You’re a man of action, aren’t you? When it occurs to you to do something you do it, nevermind the consequences Take a look Look at the consequences Here they are He loved you more than anyone in this world
<name="varys"> Apologies
<name="tyrion"> I still don’t see why I had to stay in this fucking crate once we set sail
<name="varys"> I saved your life If they catch you, they catch me I cannot say I feel overly guilty about leaving you in that fucking crate”
<name="tyrion"> Do you know what it’s like to stuff your shit through one of those air holes?
<name="varys"> No I only know what it’s like to pick up your shit and throw it overboard
<name="tyrion"> Pentos?
<name="varys"> The home of my colleague Ilyrio Mopatis A merchant He and I met many years ago, through mutual friends A group of people who saw Robert Baratheon for the disaster he was We tried to do what was best for the realm by supporting the Targaryen restoration And thus began the chain of mistakes that has led us both here Things have gotten worse, not better Westeros needs to be saved from itself
<name="tyrion"> Much better
<name="varys"> My lord?
<name="tyrion"> I don’t think I am anymore A lord Are you a lord if you kill your father? I don’t suppose they revoke your nobility for killing a whore That has to be happen all the time
<name="varys"> You already drank yourself across the Narrow Sea
<name="tyrion"> In a box Why stop now?
<name="varys"> Because we are talking about the future of our country
<name="tyrion"> The future is shit Just like the past
<name="prostitute"> You want the same? Same as always?
<name="white rat"> You you don’t have to
<name="prostitute"> Habit
<name="daenerys"> Sons of the Harpy?
<name="barristan"> Yes, your grace They left it on the body
<name="daenerys"> They’ve never killed before
<name="barristan"> It was only a matter of time, your grace Conquerors are always met with resistance
<name="daenerys"> I didn’t conquer them Their own people did
<name="mossador"> They do not see us as people, Your Grace
<name="daenerys"> Then they will have to learn to see things differently, Mossador He did not risk his life fighting for freedom so cowards in masks could take it away And I did not take up residence in this pyramid so I could watch the city below decline into chaos What was the name of the man you lost?
<name="grey worm"> White Rat, your grace
<name="daenerys"> I want him buried with honor Publicly In the Temple of the Graces
<name="barristan"> The Sons of the Harpy will hear that message
<name="mossador"> Make them very angry
<name="daenerys"> Angry snakes lash out Makes chopping off their heads that much easier Find the men who did this and bring them to me
<name="missandei"> Torgo Nudho
<name="grey worm"> Missandei hin Naath
<name="missandei"> I wanted to speak with you
<name="grey worm"> Why do you come?
<name="missandei"> White Rat, the Unsullied who I have heard they found his body in a brothel I have heard that more than one Unsullied has been known to visit Meereen’s brothels May I ask you why? Why would an Unsullied go to a brothel?
<name="grey worm"> I do not know I must go
<name="jon"> Get your shield up
<name="olly"> It’s too heavy
<name="jon"> If it wasn’t heavy it wouldn’t stop a sword, now get it up
<name="jon"> Come Try it again Drive at me Keep your shield up Or I’ll ring your head like a bell
<name="gilly"> Shouldn’t you be training, too?
<name="sam"> Well, I’m hardly a new recruit How many brothers can say they’ve killed a white walker and a Thenn? I might be the first in history
<name="alliser"> These men need a firm hand Always have They’re poachers and thieves
<name="alliser"> Not soldiers
<name="gilly"> That one hates me
<name="sam"> If Ser Alliser is chosen as the new Lord Commander he hates the wildlings
<name="sam"> All the wildlings
<name="gilly"> Don’t let them send us away
<name="sam"> It’s not a sure thing Ser Denys Mallister has commanded the Shadow Tower for 20 years, and people say he’s a good man He’s running against Ser Alliser-
<name="gilly"> Sam! Don’t let them send us away
<name="sam"> I told you Wherever you go, I go, too
<name="gilly"> You can’t leave, they’ll execute you
<name="jon"> Good, good, pivot! Don’t forget to pivot! Shield up
<name="melisandre"> The king wants a word
<name="jon"> You’re not cold, my lady?
<name="melisandre"> Never The Lord’s fire lives within me, Jon Snow
<name="melisandre"> Feel
<name="melisandre"> Are you a virgin?
<name="jon"> No
<name="melisandre"> Good
<name="melisandre"> Your grace The bastard of Winterfell
<name="stannis"> You know who rules at Winterfell now?
<name="jon"> Roose Bolton
<name="stannis"> The traitor who plunged a dagger into Robb Stark’s heart Don’t you want to avenge him?
<name="jon"> I want a great many things, your grace But I’m a sworn brother of the Night’s Watch now
<name="davos"> I’ve been talking to your sworn brothers Many of them love you
<name="jon"> They’re good men
<name="davos"> Many don’t You were seen taking the body of a wildling girl north of the Wall Why?
<name="jon"> It’s where she belonged
<name="davos"> Some of the Night’s Watch feel you have too much affection for the wildlings
<name="jon"> They were born on the wrong side of the wall That doesn’t make them monsters
<name="stannis"> No matter I shall take back the North from the thieves who stole it Tywin Lannister is dead He can’t protect them now I shall mount Roose Bolton’s head on a spike But if I’m to take Winterfell I’ll need more men
<name="jon"> The men of the Night’s Watch are sworn to play no part-
<name="stannis"> I’m not talking about the damn Night’s Watch I’m talking about the wildlings
<name="jon"> Your grace, you want the wildlings to march in your army?
<name="stannis"> If they swear to follow me, I’ll pardon them We’ll take Winterfell Once the North is won, I’ll declare them citizens of the realm I’ll give them land to live on
<name="davos"> It’s a fair offer More than fair
<name="stannis"> I’ll offer them their lives and their freedom if Mance kneels before me and swears his loyalty
<name="jon"> I don’t think that’s likely
<name="stannis"> You admire him, don’t you?
<name="jon"> I respect him
<name="stannis"> He likes you Convince him to bend the knee.
<name="jon"> Your grace
<name="stannis"> or he burns
<name="jon"> How much time do I have?
<name="stannis"> Nightfall The sun drops fast this time of year Hurry, Jon Snow
<name="sansa master of arms"> Sword up! Attack, my lord! Attack! Don’t cross your feet
<name="yohn royce"> My sons have had swords in their hands from the time they could walk This one
<name="littlefinger"> Lord Arryn will never be a great warrior
<name="royce"> Great warrior? He sings a sword like a girl with palsy
<name="squire"> My lord
<name="master of arms"> Sword up, my lord
<name="littlefinger"> Some boys develop more slowly He’s still young
<name="royce"> He’s 13 Boys go to war at 13
<name="littlefinger"> He has other gifts
<name="royce"> Does he?
<name="littlefinger"> The gift of a great name Sometimes that’s all one needs
<name="sansa"> Goodbye Lord Royce, and thank you for all you’ve done for me
<name="royce"> I have done nothing more than my duty, my lady
<name="littlefinger"> I have no doubt that upon my return, Robin’s skills will have improved immeasurably
<name="royce"> He’ll be safe here As for his skills, I make no promises
<name="podrick"> Will we head north at some point? He said Sansa had a brother at Castle Black We’re a few days ride from the Kingsroad, but that will take us-
<name="brienne"> Us? The only reason you’re here is that Jaime Lannister told me you weren’t safe in the capital You’re hundreds of miles from King’s Landing No one knows what you look like No one cares You’re safe
<name="podrick"> But I’m you’re squire
<name="brienne"> Do you even know what a squire is?
<name="podrick"> An attendant to a knight?
<name="brienne"> I’m not a knight That means you’re not a squire
<name="podrick"> Well, where would I go?
<name="brienne"> I don’t care, I’m not your mother
<name="podrick"> You swore to find the Stark girls
<name="brienne"> I found Arya She didn’t want my protection
<name="podrick"> Sansa still might
<name="brienne"> Will you shut your mouth? I didn’t ask for advice I don’t want anyone following me I’m not a leader All I ever wanted is to fight for a Lord I believed in The good lords are dead and the rest are monsters
<name="sansa"> You told Lord Royce we were going to the Fingers
<name="littlefinger"> I did
<name="sansa"> But we’re heading west
<name="littlefinger"> We are
<name="sansa"> If he wanted to betray us, he already would have
<name="littlefinger"> Lord Royce may be as honorable as he thinks he is, but he’s not alone in that castle Do you trust all those knights and ladies, stable boys and serving girls?
<name="sansa"> No Do you trust the carriage driver or the knights escorting us?
<name="littlefinger"> No But I pay them well, and they’ve seen what happens to men who disappoint me
<name="sansa"> So where are we going? To a land where you trust everyone?
<name="littlefinger"> So a land so far from here, even Cersei Lannister can’t get her hands on you
<name="loras"> It was such a deep, deep shock to us all Your father was a force to be reckoned with He truly was I wouldn’t presume to claim to have known him as such
<name="loras"> But just being in his presence was enough to make it so clear just how formidable a person you were dealing with What a what a force to be reckoned with
<name="cersei"> Thank you so much for your kind words
<name="grand maester pyrcelle"> Deepest condolences, your grace This tragedy I never trusted Varys I often warned
<name="lancel"> Your grace
<name="cersei"> Cousin Lancel I hardly recognized you
<name="lancel"> My deepest sympathies
<name="kevan"> I apologize for my son’s appearance
<name="cersei"> Uncle, it’s quite alright
<name="kevan"> They call themselves sparrows Bloody fanatics Religion has its place, of course, but at a certain point They never would have come to the capital when Tywin was alive
<name="cersei"> I’m sure he’ll grow out of it Whatever it is Excuse me
<name="kevan"> Of course
<name="cersei"> Your wounds from the Blackwater seem to have healed
<name="lancel"> It wasn’t my wounds that needed healing
<name="cersei"> What can I do for you?
<name="lancel"> You can forgive me
<name="cersei"> What could you possibly have done to warrant my forgiveness?
<name="lancel"> I led you into the darkness
<name="cersei"> I doubt you’ve ever led anyone anywhere
<name="lancel"> I tempted you into our unnatural relations And, of course, there was the king His boar hunt His wine
<name="cersei"> I don’t know what you’re talking about
<name="lancel"> I’m a different person now I found peace in the light of the Seven You can too They watch over all of us, ready to dole out mercy or justice Their world is at hand I will pray for your father’s soul
<name="cersei"> The day Tywin Lannister’s soul needs your help
<name="olyvar"> It looks like Dorne
<name="loras"> No it doesn’t
<name="olyvar"> It does That’s the Sunspear bit right there And that’s where the mountains are And over here is Sunsnake? Stonespear?
<name="loras"> Sandstone
<name="olyvar"> Yes Yes, Sandstone Just there
<name="loras"> Fine
<name="loras"> It’s Dorne
<name="olyvar"> We should go there I think we would have a lovely time
<name="loras"> Judging by my experience, that would be wonderful Dorne, Highgarden Anywhere but here
<name="margaery"> We’re late for dinner as it is
<name="loras"> You’re very respectful
<name="margaery"> I’m very hungry
<name="margaery"> What’s your name?
<name="olyvar"> Olyvar, my lady
<name="margaery"> I’m afraid my brother is keeping the king waiting, Olyvar
<name="margaery"> Perhaps you might consider being a bit more discreet?
<name="loras"> Why? They all know about me anyway Everybody knows everything about everyone What’s the point in trying to keep a secret in a place like this?
<name="margaery"> In any event you shouldn’t keep your intended waiting
<name="loras"> My intended? Please Tywin’s dead That means no one can force Cersei to marry me
<name="margaery"> Lucky you
<name="loras"> Unlucky you
<name="margaery"> You think I want that woman married to my brother?
<name="loras"> If she doesn’t marry me, she doesn’t go to Highgarden Which means she stays in King’s Landing Which means you’re trapped here with Cersei Lannister as your mother-by-law
<name="margaery"> Perhaps
<name="loras"> Perhaps?
<name="margaery"> Perhaps?
<name="tyrion"> Eunuch, the spider, the master of whisperers
<name="varys"> Imp, half-man
<name="varys"> There are faster ways to kill yourself
<name="tyrion"> Not for a coward
<name="varys"> You are many things, my friend, but not a coward
<name="tyrion"> You never told me why you set me free
<name="varys"> Your brother asked me to
<name="tyrion"> You could have said no
<name="varys"> Refuse the Kingslayer? A dangerous proposition
<name="tyrion"> Not as dangerous as releasing me You risked your life, your position, everything Why? You’re not family, you owe me nothing
<name="varys"> I didn’t do it for you I did it for the Seven Kingdoms
<name="tyrion"> A drunken dwarf will never be the savior of the Seven Kingdoms
<name="varys"> I don’t believe in saviors I believe men of talent have a role to play in the war to come
<name="tyrion"> You’re going to have to find another soldier I’m done with Westeros and Westeros is done with me
<name="varys"> You have many admirable qualities, self-pity is not one of them Any fool with a bit of luck can find himself born into power But earning it for yourself, that takes work
<name="tyrion"> I’m not well-suited for work
<name="varys"> I think you are You have your father’s instinct for politics, and you have compassion
<name="tyrion"> Compassion? Yes I killed my lover with my bare hands I shot my own father with a crossbow
<name="varys"> I never said you were perfect
<name="tyrion"> What is it you want exactly?
<name="varys"> Peace Prosperity A land where the powerful do not prey on the powerless
<name="tyrion"> Where the castles are made of gingerbread and the moats are filled with blackberry wine The powerful have always preyed on the powerless, that’s how they became powerful in the first place
<name="varys"> Perhaps And perhaps we’ve grown so used to horror we assume there’s no other way If you sat on the Iron Throne, would you spread misery throughout the land?
<name="tyrion"> I will never sit on the Iron Throne
<name="varys"> No, you won’t But you could help another climb those steps and take that seat The Seven Kingdoms need someone stronger than Tommen, but gentler than Stannis A monarch who can intimidate the high lord and inspire the people A ruler loved by millions with a powerful army and the right family name
<name="tyrion"> Good luck finding him
<name="varys"> Who said anything about him? You have a choice my friend You can stay here at Ilyrio’s palace and drink yourself to death, or you can ride with me to Mereen, meet Daenerys Targaryen, and decide if the world is worth fighting for
<name="tyrion"> Can I drink myself to death on the road to Meereen?
<name="daario naharis"> When did the Unsullied start patrolling the streets of Meereen? Looks like your friends haven’t been behaving themselves
<name="hizdahr zo loraq"> The mission to Yunkai was a resounding success The Wise Masters of Yunkai have agreed to cede power to a council of elders, made up of both the freedmen and the former slaveholders All matters of consequence will be brought to you for review
<name="daenerys"> Good
<name="hizdahr"> They did ask for some concessions
<name="daenerys"> Concessions?
<name="hizdahr"> Politics is the art of compromise, your grace
<name="daenerys"> I’m not a politician I’m a queen
<name="hizdahr"> Forgive me You’re right, of course Still, it’s easier to rule happy subjects than angry ones
<name="daenerys"> I don’t expect the Wise Masters to be happy Slavery made them rich, I ended slavery
<name="hizdahr"> They do not ask for the return of slavery They ask for the re-opening of the fighting pits
<name="daenerys"> The fighting pits? Where slaves fought slaves to the death?
<name="hizdahr"> In the new world that you’ve brought to us, free men would fight free men
<name="hizdahr"> The pitfighters that you liberated plead for this opportunity Bring some here and ask them yourself
<name="daenerys"> No fighting pits
<name="hizdahr"> Opening them would show the people of Yunkai and Meereen that you respect their traditions
<name="daenerys"> I do not respect the tradition of human cockfighting
<name="hizdahr"> If you-
<name="daenerys"> How many times must I say no before you understand?
<name="daenerys"> Whatever he wants from me he’s not going to get it If he really believes I’m going to reopen the fighting pits
<name="daario"> You should reopen the fighting pits
<name="daenerys"> What?
<name="daario"> My mother was a whore, I told you that She liked to drink pear brandy The older she got, the less she made selling her body, the more she wanted to drink So one day when I was 12, she sold me to a slaver she fucked the night before
<name="daenerys"> Why?
<name="daario"> I was a bad child I wasn’t big, but I was quick And I loved to fight So they sold me to a man in Tolos who trained fighters for the pits I had my first match when I was 16
<name="daenerys"> You were sold into slavery, forced to fight to the death for the amusement of the masters, and you’re defending the fighting pits?
<name="daario"> I’m only here because of those pits I learned to fight like a Dothraki screamer, a Norvoshi priest, a Westerosi knight Soon I was famous 10,000 men and women screamed my name when I stepped into the pit I made so much money for my master he set me free when I died I joined the Second Sons, and then I met you
<name="daario"> You’re the queen Everyone’s too afraid of you to speak truth Everyone but me You’ve made thousands of enemies all across the world As soon as they see weakness, they’ll attack Show your strength here, now
<name="daenerys"> That’s why I have the Unsullied patrolling the streets
<name="daario"> Anyone with a chest full of gold can buy an army of Unsullied You’re not the Mother of Unsullied You’re the Mother of Dragons
<name="daenerys"> I don’t want another child’s bones dropped at my feet No one’s seen Drogon in weeks For all I know he’s flown halfway across the world I can’t control them anymore
<name="daario"> A dragon queen with no dragons is not a queen
<name="daenerys"> Viserion? Rhaegal?
<name="daenerys"> Easy Easy Easy
<name="mance"> So here we are
<name="jon"> Here we are
<name="mance"> When we first met you were my prisoner And now, for our last meeting
<name="jon"> This doesn’t have to be our last meeting
<name="mance"> No, but it will be
<name="jon"> You know what Stannis wants?
<name="mance"> He wants me to bend the knee And he wants the free folk to fight for him I’ll give him this much he’s bold
<name="jon"> Shouldn’t a king be bold?
<name="mance"> Oh, aye I respect him If he gets what he wants, I expect he’ll be a better ruler than the fools sitting on the Iron Throne the last hundred years But I’ll never serve him
<name="jon"> You told me you weren’t here to conquer You told me your people have bled enough
<name="mance"> That’s right But I don’t want them bleeding for Stannis Baratheon either
<name="jon"> You spent your life convincing 90 clans to come together for the first time in history Thenns and Hornfoots, the ice-river clans, even the giants A life’s work uniting them You didn’t do it for power You didn’t do it for glory You brought them together to save them because none of them will survive the winter, not if they’re north of the wall Isn’t their survival more important than your pride?
<name="mance"> Pride? Fuck my pride This isn’t about that
<name="jon"> Then bend the knee and save your people
<name="mance"> They followed me because they respected me Because they believed in me The moment I kneel for a Southern king that’s all gone
<name="jon"> And how many tens of thousands are out there right now? How many women? How many children? And you won’t go out and rescue them because why? You’re afraid of looking afraid
<name="mance"> Oh, I am afraid No shame in that How will they do it? Beheading? Hanging?
<name="jon"> They’ll burn you alive
<name="mance"> Bad way to go I’ll be honest with you, I don’t want to die And burnt to death, I don’t want people to remember me like that Scorched and screaming But it’s better than betraying everything I believe
<name="jon"> And what happens to your people? You preserve your dignity and die standing, and they’ll sing songs about you You’d rather burn than kneel The great hero.” Until winter comes, and the white walkers come for us all, and there’s no one left to sing
<name="mance"> You’re a good lad Truly, you are But if you can’t understand why I won’t enlist my people in a foreigner’s war, there’s no point explaining
<name="jon"> I think you’re making a terrible mistake
<name="mance"> The freedom to make my own mistakes was all I ever wanted
<name="stannis"> Mance Rayder, you’ve been called the King Beyond the Wall Westeros only has one king Bend the knee, I promise you mercy
<name="stannis"> Kneel and live
<name="mance"> This was my home for many years I wish you good fortune in the wars to come
<name="melisandre"> Man or woman, young or old, lord or peasant, our choices are the same We choose light, or we choose darkness We choose good, or we choose evil We choose the true god or the false

<name="arya"> When do I get to play the game?
<name="waif"> Game?
<name="arya"> The game The game of faces
<name="waif"> You tried already You failed
<name="arya"> I didn’t even know I was playing
<name="waif"> Who are you?
<name="arya"> No one
<name="waif"> Get back to work
<name="arya"> Well who are you? What are you doing here? How’d you get here?
<name="waif"> I’m from Westeros Just like you Daughter of a Lord Just like you Except I was an only child Heir to his fortune My mother died My father remarried and his new wife gave birth to a girl My stepmother didn’t want any rivals for her precious daughter so she tried to kill me with poison I found out, sought help from the Faceless Men and my father was widowed again I’ve been serving them ever since
<name="beat waif"> Was that true or a lie?
<name="arya"> What?
<name="waif"> Did you believe every word I said?
<name="waif"> Get back to work
<name="jaqen"> Who are you?
<name="jaqen"> Who are you?
<name="arya"> Arya
<name="jaqen"> And where did you come from?
<name="arya"> Westeros My family home is Winterfell I’m the youngest daughter of a great lord Eddard Stark He died in battle
<name="jaqen"> A lie
<name="arya"> After he was executed I fled the capital Had to kill a stable boy Drove my sword through his back
<name="jaqen"> A lie
<name="arya"> I stabbed him in the gut I tried to find my mother and brother I never did They were murdered by Walder Frey An outlaw kidnapped me A man called Polliver
<name="jaqen"> A lie
<name="arya"> A man called the Hound Sandor Clegane He tried to sell me but was wounded in a fight He begged me to kill him but I wouldn’t I left him in the mountains to die I wanted him to suffer, I hated him
<name="arya"> I hated him
<name="arya"> I hated him
<name="arya"> That’s not a lie
<name="jaqen"> The girl lies To me To the Many Faced God To herself Does she truly want to be no one?
<name="arya"> Yes
<name="arya"> I’m not playing this stupid game anymore
<name="jaqen"> We never stop playing
<name="tyrion"> So, those villages we were supposed to find We can’t live on berries and roots
<name="jorah"> I can
<name="tyrion"> You’re not hungry?
<name="jorah"> Of course I’m hungry
<name="tyrion"> You’re an awful travelling companion, do you know that? Possibly the least charming man I have ever met
<name="jorah"> I am not your travelling companion
<name="tyrion"> We are travelling together In each other’s company Therefore
<name="jorah"> Do you ever shut up?
<name="tyrion"> I sailed from King’s Landing to Pentos in a crate Without ever saying a word
<name="jorah"> Why?
<name="tyrion"> Never occurred to you to ask why until now? You never wondered why Tyrion Lannister decided to visit a brothel in Volantis
<name="jorah"> I’m sure you’ve visited many brothels in many cities
<name="tyrion"> I killed my father He wanted to execute me for a crime I didn’t commit And he was fucking the woman I loved
<name="tyrion"> As miserable as you are, Mormont, at least your father was a good man
<name="jorah"> What do you know about my father?
<name="tyrion"> I met him I visited the Wall When I asked him about his men he knew all the stories, every one of them He actually cared about the people in his command How did they put it in the Watch? We shall never see his like again
<name="tyrion"> You didn’t know I’m sorry I am
<name="jorah"> How?
<name="tyrion"> I only know what I heard
<name="jorah"> How?
<name="tyrion"> He was leading an expedition beyond the wall There was a mutiny He was murdered by his own men
<name="jorah"> We better keep moving
<name="man"> Valar morghulis
<name="arya"> Valar dohaeris
<name="man"> I have nowhere else to go I’ve taken her to every healer in Braavos I’ve spent every penny I had She suffers every day of her life I just want it to end
<name="girl"> It hurts
<name="arya"> I know Don’t be afraid I used to be like you I was sick I was dying But my father never gave up on me He loved me More than anything in the world, just like your father loves you So he brought me here My father prayed to the many faced god And I drank the water from this fountain It healed me
<name="arya"> I’ve devoted my life to him now You don’t want to hurt anymore Drink
<name="jaqen"> Is the girl ready to give up her ears, her nose, her tongue, her hopes and dreams, her loves and hates, all that makes a girl who she is, forever?
<name="jaqen"> No The girl is not ready to become no one But she is ready to become someone else
<name="tyrion"> Why Daenerys? Why is she worth all this? As I recall, the Mormonts fought against the Targaryens during Robert’s Rebellion
<name="jorah"> Do you believe in anything?
<name="tyrion"> I believe in many things
<name="jorah"> In something greater than ourselves, I mean The Gods Destiny Do you believe theres a plan for this world?
<name="tyrion"> No
<name="jorah"> Neither did I I was a cynic, just like you Then I saw a girl step into a great fire with three stone eggs When the fire burned out I thought I’d find her blackened bones Instead I found her Daenerys Alive and unhurt Holding her baby dragons Have you ever heard baby dragons singing?
<name="tyrion"> No
<name="jorah"> Its hard to be a cynic after that
<name="tyrion"> Doesn’t mean she’s going to be a great queen
<name="jorah"> No it doesn’t
<name="tyrion"> The Targaryens are famously insane What if she conquers the world? Then what? 1,000 years of peace and prosperity?
<name="jorah"> First we have to conquer the world
<name="tyrion"> We? Alright, let’s assume your dreams come true She’s ecstatic when you bring her this enemy dwarf She hacks off my head and restores your position You command her army, sail to Westeros, defeat all your enemies, then watch as she climbs those steps and sits on the Iron Throne Hurrah, long live the Queen Then what?
<name="jorah"> Then she rules
<name="tyrion"> So a woman who has not spent a single day of her adult life in Westeros becomes the ruler of Westeros? That’s justice?
<name="jorah"> She is the rightful heir
<name="tyrion"> Why, because her father who burned living men for amusement was the king?
<name="jorah"> Shh! It’s a slave ship
<name="tyrion"> Why is it anchored?
<name="jorah"> They probably came ashore for-
<name="malko"> water
<name="malko"> Got a lot of fight in you, huh?
<name="slaver"> Salt mines
<name="malko"> That or a galley slave He looks strong enough
<name="slaver"> What about the dwarf?
<name="malko"> Worthless Cut his throat
<name="tyrion"> Wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, let’s discuss this
<name="malko"> And then chop off his cock We can sell it for a fortune A dwarf’s cock has magic powers
<name="tyrion"> Wait, wait, wait, wait! You can’t just hand a dried cock to a merchant and expect him to pay for it He has to know it came from a dwarf And how could he know unless he sees the dwarf?
<name="slaver"> It will be a dwarf-sized cock
<name="tyrion"> Guess again
<name="malko"> The dwarf lives until we find a cock merchant
<name="jorah"> Queen Daenerys has outlawed slavery
<name="malko"> We’re bound to Volantis, not Slaver’s Bay Besides, she reopened the fighting pits I never heard of free men fighting in the pits
<name="tyrion"> The fighting puts in Mereen! You’re in luck then, you’re about to be rich You are looking at one of the great warriors in the seven kingdoms
<name="tyrion"> Him
<name="malko"> Him? He’s got to be 60 years old
<name="tyrion"> Sure, he’s a bit long in the tooth, a bit withered, been in the sun too long We can all see that But he is a veteran of 100 battles They wrote songs about him
<name="malko"> Is that true?
<name="tyrion"> He won the tournament at Lannisport, unseating Ser Jaime Lannister himself
<name="tyrion"> ingslayer
<name="malko"> Jousting You’re talking about jousting A fancy game for fancy lads The men who fight at Mereen will swallow him whole
<name="jorah"> I killed a Dothraki blood rider in single combat
<name="malko"> Liar
<name="jorah"> It’s no lie His name was Qotho He was bloodrider to Khal Drogo Take me to Slaver’s Bay, put a sword in my hand, I’ll prove my worth
<name="lancel"> Lord Baelish
<name="littlefinger"> Yes? Lancel Lannister
<name="lancel"> Brother Lancel We abandoned our family names
<name="littlefinger"> That’s quite a family to abandon
<name="lancel"> The city has changed since you were here last We flooded the gutters with wine, smashed the false idols, and sent the godless on the run
<name="littlefinger"> Well done
<name="littlefinger"> I’m here on urgent business for the Queen Mother Should I send word that I’ll be delayed?
<name="lancel"> Step carefully, Lord Baelish You’ll find that there’s little tolerance for flesh peddlers in the new King’s Landing
<name="littlefinger"> We both peddle fantasies, Brother Lancel Mine just happen to be entertaining
<name="littlefinger"> Do you think it’s wise, your Grace, arresting the heir to Highgarden?
<name="cersei"> The Faith arrested the heir to Highgarden
<name="littlefinger"> Of course And the Faith were armed on your orders
<name="cersei"> ing’s orders Is the King to blame for Ser Loras’ perversion?
<name="littlefinger"> House Tyrell won’t tolerate these insults
<name="cersei"> House Tyrell won’t tolerate it? I’m the insulted party, Lord Baelish Ser Loras was promised to me, instead he chose the company of boys
<name="littlefinger"> One’s choice of companion is a curious thing
<name="cersei"> Most curious Lysa Arryn for instance A sorrily repellent woman Forgive me I know you’re still in mourning
<name="littlefinger"> Lysa was a good woman A kind woman
<name="cersei"> She was neither of those things, we both know it Still, I pity her son How fortunate that the young Lord of the Vale has a new father to counsel him
<name="littlefinger"> I know how hard it can be to lose both of your parents at such a young age
<name="cersei"> If war comes to Westeros will the Knights of the Veil fight for their king?
<name="littlefinger"> Young Lord Robyn heeds my advice And I have always counseled loyalty to the throne
<name="cersei"> Good If there’s nothing else
<name="littlefinger"> There is another matter, your Grace Something so urgent I couldn’t trust the words to a raven You once charged me with finding Arya Stark To my shame I failed you But I have found Sansa Stark Alive, and well, and home again In Winterfell
<name="cersei"> That’s not possible
<name="littlefinger"> My sources are well placed They tell me Roose Bolton plans to marry her to his son, Ramsay, a bastard recently legitimized by King Tommen
<name="cersei"> Roose Bolton is Warden of the North by the grace of my father
<name="littlefinger"> Indeed As reward for stabbing his own king in the heart
<name="cersei"> We were fools to trust a turncloak
<name="littlefinger"> Marrying his son to the last of the Starks gives him more legitimacy in the North than an alliance with a hated southern house
<name="cersei"> I will skin him and his bastard like that wretch on that bloody sigil
<name="littlefinger"> I would counsel patience, your grace
<name="cersei"> Patience? Sansa helped murder my son, Roose Bolton is a traitor
<name="littlefinger"> Stannis Baratheon is also a traitor, marching with his army on Winterfell Let Stannis and Roose battle, let the enemies of the throne slaughter each other and when they’re done seize Winterfell from whichever thief survives
<name="cersei"> Winterfell is 1,000 miles away from here The weather has already begun to turn
<name="littlefinger"> That is why it is critical to strike soon, while the victor still licks his wounds Surely your Uncle Kevan could muster a force
<name="cersei"> My Uncle Kevan has all the courage of a kitchen mouse
<name="littlefinger"> Ser Jaime, then
<name="cersei"> Jaime is away on a sensitive diplomatic mission I’ve no idea when he’ll be back
<name="littlefinger"> Perhaps I can help nights of the Vale are some of the best fighters in Westeros, trained to battle in the ice and the snow
<name="cersei"> Forgive me Lord Baelish, you have a reputation as a money lender and brothel keeper, not a military man
<name="littlefinger"> You wouldn’t risk a single Lannister soldier or a single coin from the Royal Treasury What do you have to lose, a brothel keeper?
<name="cersei"> And if you succeed?
<name="littlefinger"> Name me Warden of the North
<name="cersei"> I’ll speak to the king this evening Have him issue a royal decree
<name="littlefinger"> I’ll not rest until the lion flies over Winterfell
<name="cersei"> And I’ll l know you’re a man of your word when I see Sansa Stark’s head on a spike
<name="littlefinger"> As I said I live to serve
<name="trystane"> I’m going to ask him tomorrow
<name="myrcella"> What if he says no?
<name="trystane"> He won’t You’ve waited long enough I want you to be my wife now What is it?
<name="myrcella"> Do you want to marry me because our families arranged it, or do you
<name="myrcella"> We can’t Not yet
<name="trystane"> Why not?
<name="myrcella"> You know why not Someone will see
<name="trystane"> You are going to be my wife I am going to be your husband We are allowed to walk through the gardens together
<name="myrcella"> How many other girls have you walked through these gardens?
<name="trystane"> I like the way your eyes go squinty when you’re jealous
<name="myrcella"> They don’t go squinty, and you didnt answer the question
<name="doran"> They make a lovely couple A Lannister and a Martell They have no idea how dangerous that is We must protect them
<name="areo"> Yes, my prince
<name="doran"> You have not had to use that axe of yours in a very long time I hope you remember how
<name="areo"> I remember how
<name="bronn"> The Dornishman’s wife was as fair as the sun and her kisses were warmer than spring The Dornishman’s blade it was made of black steel and its kiss was a terrible thing The Dornishman’s wife would sing as she bathed in a voice that was sweet as a peach.
<name="jaime"> Alright, thats enough
<name="bronn"> I’m coming to the best part
<name="jaime"> We’re trying to blend in We don’t want everyone in Dorne to hear your accent
<name="bronn"> This song really is all about the ending
<name="jaime"> It can wait Up there
<name="jaime"> That’s the Water Gardens
<name="bronn"> Once we got the princess, then what?
<name="jaime"> I like to improvise
<name="bronn"> That explains the golden hand
<name="ellaria"> Unbowed, unbent, unbroken For Oberyn
<name="sand snakes"> For Oberyn
<name="bronn"> Well, she’s made herself at home
<name="jaime"> Myrcella
<name="myrcella"> Uncle Jaime? I don’t understand, what are you doing here?
<name="jaime"> Let’s speak in private
<name="trystane"> I am Trystane Martell
<name="myrcella"> Trystane is my intended
<name="jaime"> Excellent Good to meet you
<name="trystane"> We weren’t expecting you, Ser Jaime
<name="bronn"> Why don’t you let them have some time alone, son?
<name="bronn"> Let’s not do something stupid
<name="myrcella"> No
<name="bronn"> That was something stupid
<name="jaime"> We have to go, Myrcella, now
<name="myrcella"> You hurt him
<name="jaime"> You’ll be fine, I promise, but we have to-
<name="bronn"> Oh for fuck’s sake
<name="obara"> You’re coming with me
<name="myrcella"> I don’t want to
<name="obara"> I wasn’t asking, princess
<name="areo"> Drop you weapons
<name="obara"> I am Obara Sand Daughter of Oberyn Martell I fight for Dorne Who do you fight for?
<name="areo"> Drop your weapons
<name="areo"> When you were whole, it would have been a good fight
<name="bronn"> You fight pretty good for a little girl
<name="rider"> Halt
<name="olenna"> Oh! You can smell the shit from 5 miles away Well, why are we stopped, go on
<name="olenna"> Rumors and gossip, that’s all they got It’s theater, nothing more If they arrested all the pillow biters in King’s Landing there’d be no room left in the dungeons for anyone else
<name="margaery"> Everyone knew about him and Renly
<name="olenna"> Renly Baratheon shagged half the stable boys in the Seven Kingdoms Everyone knew No one cared
<name="margaery"> But he was the king’s brother
<name="olenna"> And Loras is the queen’s brother No, no, no, no, this is unacceptable
<name="margaery"> Cersei is behind this
<name="olenna"> Of course she is She wants to drag our names through the dirt Put us in our place Get some rest, dear, you look appalling Let me deal with Cersei Lannister
<name="olenna"> Your Grace, I have travelled a long way
<name="cersei"> You must be exhausted
<name="olenna"> Put the pen down, dear, we all know you aren’t writing anything
<name="cersei"> Ah, yes, the famously tart-tongued queen of thorns
<name="olenna"> And the famous tart Queen Cersei
<name="cersei"> Beg your pardon
<name="olenna"> I know you’re behind this absurd incarceration of my grandson
<name="cersei"> If you apologize for that comment perhaps-
<name="olenna"> You’ll get your apology when I get Loras
<name="cersei"> I was as shocked as anyone when The Faith arrested Ser Loras I have no love for these fanatics But what can the queen mother do?
<name="olenna"> Has the crown suddenly stopped needing the troops, gold, and wheat my house supplies?
<name="cersei"> I assure you our alliance with House Tyrell remains-
<name="olenna"> Do you expect the alliance to continue after you’ve thrown our future into prison?
<name="cersei"> As I said, i didn’t imprison anyone As for your veiled threats-
<name="olenna"> What veil?
<name="cersei"> The Lannister-Tyrell alliance brought peace to a war-torn country Do you really want to see the Seven Kingdoms slide back into warfare?
<name="olenna"> I didn’t trust your father I didn’t particularly like him But I respected him He was no fool He understood that sometimes we must work with our rivals rather than destroy them
<name="cersei"> House Lannister has no rival The High Septon has called for an inquest, not a trial Just a small hearing to determine whether the charges against Loras have merit, which I’m sure they don’t Loras will be freed, our happy alliance will continue, and we’ll forget this unfortunate conversation ever happened Good day, Lady Olenna
<name="high sparrow"> You are aware of the rumors concerning you and Renly?
<name="loras"> I don’t pay attention to rumors
<name="sparrow"> You were said to be despondent when he died Witnesses said that you refused to leave his bedside, even as Stannis
<name="army closed in loras"> He was my friend He was my king
<name="sparrow"> Wasn’t Joffrey your king? He was anointed by the 7, not Renly
<name="loras"> I was wrong to support Renly’s claim I know that But I was forgiven by Joffrey I fought for him at the Battle of the Blackwater
<name="sparrow"> Wearing Renly’s armor
<name="loras"> Why does it matter what I wore?
<name="sparrow"> Do you deny all of the charges against you? Fornication, buggery, blasphemy
<name="loras"> Of course I deny them
<name="sparrow"> You never lay with Renly Baratheon
<name="loras"> Never
<name="sparrow"> Nor any other man
<name="loras"> Never
<name="sparrow"> That will be all Ser Loras
<name="olenna"> Well I think that’s quite enough of that
<name="sparrow"> Faith calls Queen Margaery forward
<name="margaery"> You call me forward?
<name="sparrow"> Yes We have some questions for you
<name="margaery"> I am the queen
<name="sparrow"> You are And according to Law of the Seven, neither kings nor queens are exempt from testimony at a holy inquest
<name="sparrow"> How do you respond to these charges against your brother?
<name="margaery"> They are lies
<name="sparrow"> All of them?
<name="margaery"> All of them
<name="sparrow"> Queen Margaery, in the presence of the gods, do you swear that your brother is innocent of these charges against him, to the best of your knowledge?
<name="margaery"> Yes, I swear it
<name="sparrow"> Thank you, your grace
<name="sparrow"> Do you know this man?
<name="olyvar"> Yes, very well He is Ser Loras Tyrell, heir to Highgarden
<name="sparrow"> How did you come to meet?
<name="olyvar"> I squired for him He took a liking to me He summoned me to his chamber the first day we met
<name="sparrow"> And what occurred in his chamber?
<name="olyvar"> We engaged in intimate relations
<name="sparrow"> You laid with him?
<name="olyvar"> That night and many others
<name="loras"> Liar! He’s a liar
<name="sparrow"> Is there anyone else who can support your claim?
<name="olyvar"> Yes, yes, Queen Margaery She walked in on us once not long ago She didn’t seem surprised
<name="cersei"> This testimony is an insult to a great house Why should The Faith or anyone else take the word of a squire over the heir to Highgarden?
<name="olyvar"> He has a birthmark, your grace Quite high on his thigh, wine-colored, and roughly the shape of Dorne
<name="loras"> Liar
<name="olenna"> What are you doing? Let us pass
<name="sparrow"> The Faith is satisfied that there is enough evidence to bring a formal trial for Ser Loras and Queen Margaery
<name="margaery"> What?
<name="sparrow"> Bearing false witness before the gods is as grave a sin as any Take her
<name="margaery"> Tommen! Tommen
<name="margaery"> You can’t do this, I am the queen! Tommen, Tommen! I am your queen, how dare you
<name="sansa"> What do you want?
<name="myranda"> Lord Ramsay sent me to draw your bath, my lady You want to be clean and fresh for your new husband don’t you?
<name="myranda"> You’re so beautiful But if you need to keep him happy Ramsay gets bored easily You dont want to end up like Well, like the others
<name="sansa"> What others?
<name="myranda"> I shouldn’t gossip It’s good to see the red again No point in hiding anymore
<name="sansa"> What others?
<name="myranda"> Let’s see There was Kiera The blacksmith’s daughter She was tall Like you Lovely figure But she talked and talked and talked and Ramsay got tired of that Then there was Violet She had gorgeous blond hair But she got pregnant and, well, that was boring Then Tamsay Such a sweet girl Of course sweet girls get a bit dull after a while, don’t they? Ramsay let me come with him on that hunt
<name="sansa"> Hunt?
<name="myranda"> Mm Have you ever seen a body after the dogs have been at it? Not so pretty But it’s your wedding day, why am I talking about such things?
<name="sansa"> What was your name again?
<name="myranda"> Myranda
<name="sansa"> And how long have you loved him, Myranda Did you imagine that he would be with you forever, is that it? Then I came along and ruined it I am Sansa Stark of Winterfell This is my home and you can’t frighten me
<name="myranda"> Are you done with your bath, my lady?
<name="sansa"> Go I can finish on my own
<name="sansa"> Yes?
<name="theon"> I’ve come to escort you to the Godswood, my lady If you please, my lady, will you take my arm?
<name="sansa"> No
<name="theon"> Lord Ramsay, he said Im to take your arm
<name="sansa"> I’m not touching you
<name="theon"> Please He’ll punish me
<name="sansa"> Do you think I care what he does to you
<name="roose"> Who comes before the Old Gods this night?
<name="theon"> Sansa of the House Stark comes here to be wed A woman grown, trueborn and noble She comes to beg the blessings of the gods Who comes to claim her?
<name="ramsay"> Ramsay of House Bolton Heir to the Dreadfort and Winterfell Who gives her?
<name="theon"> Theon of House Greyjoy Who was who was her father’s ward
<name="roose"> Lady Sansa, will you take this man?
<name="sansa"> I take this man
<name="ramsay"> Are you pleased my lady?
<name="ramsay"> Good I want you to be happy My father said you’re still a virgin
<name="sansa"> Yes
<name="ramsay"> Why? Why are you still a virgin? Afraid of dwarves?
<name="sansa"> Lord Tyrion was kind, he was gentle, he never touched me
<name="ramsay"> You’re not lying to me?
<name="sansa"> No, my lord
<name="ramsay"> Lying to your husband on his wedding night, that would be a very bad way to start a marriage We are man and wife now, we should be honest with each other, don’t you think?
<name="sansa"> Yes sir
<name="ramsay"> Good Now take off your clothes
<name="ramsay"> Oh, no no no You stay here Reek You watch Do I need to ask a second time? I hate asking a second time
<name="ramsay"> Reek? I told you to watch




Season 6
EPISODE "BATTLE OF THE BASTARDS" - 19/06/2016


<name="tyrion"> Despite appearances, I think you’ll find the city’s on the rise
<name="tyrion"> Perhaps we should take shelter
<name="daenerys"> The city is on the rise?
<name="tyrion"> Meereen is strong Commerce has returned to the markets The people are behind you
<name="tyrion"> Well, not all the people, of course No ruler that ever lived had the support of all the people But the rebirth of Meereen is the cause of this violence The Masters cannot let Meereen succeed Because if Meereen succeeds, a city without slavery, a city without Masters
<name="tyrion"> it proves that no one needs a Master
<name="daenerys"> Good Shall we begin?
<name="tyrion"> Do we have a plan?
<name="daenerys"> I will crucify the Masters I will set their fleets afire, kill every last one of their soldiers, and return their cities to the dirt That is my plan
<name="daenerys"> You don’t approve?
<name="tyrion"> You once told me you knew what your father was Did you know his plans for King’s Landing when the Lannister armies were at his gates?
<name="tyrion"> Probably not Well, he told my brother and Jaime told me He had caches of wildfire hidden under the Red Keep, the Guildhalls, the Sept of Baelor, all the major thoroughfares He would have burned every one of his citizens The loyal ones and the trators Every man, woman, and child That’s why Jaime killed him
<name="daenerys"> This is entirely different
<name="tyrion"> You’re talking about destroying cities It’s not entirely different I’d like to suggest an alternate approach
<name="razdal"> Once before, I offered you peace If you had not been so arrogant, you could have returned to your homeland with a fleet of ships Instead, you will flee Slaver’s Bay on foot like the beggar queen you are
<name="tyrion"> We are here to discuss terms of surrender, not to trade insults
<name="yezzan"> The terms are simple You and your foreign friends will abandon the Great Pyramid and the city of Meereen The Unsullied you stole from Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder The translator you stole from Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder The dragons beneath the Great Pyramid will be slaughtered
<name="daenerys"> We obviously didn’t communicate clearly We’re here to discuss your surrender, not mine
<name="razdal"> I imagine it’s difficult adjust to the new reality Your reign is over
<name="daenerys"> My reign has just begun
<name="daenerys"> Dracarys
<name="grey worm"> You men have a choice
<name="grey worm"> fight and die for the masters who would never fight and die for you, or go home to your families
<name="tyrion"> Thank you for the armada Our queen does love ships Now, last time we spoke, we made a pact You violated that pact You declared war upon us Though our queen does have a forgiving nature, this cannot be forgiven
<name="missandei"> Our queen insists that one of you must die as punishment for your crimes
<name="tyrion"> It always seems a bit abstract, doesn’t it, other people dying?
<name="razdal"> Him He should die
<name="belicho"> Yes, him
<name="razdal"> He’s not one of us He’s an outsider, a lowborn He does not speak for us
<name="yezzan"> Please
<name="tyrion"> Tell your people what happened here Tell them you live by the grace of Her Majesty When they come forward with notions of retribution or ideas about returning the slave cities to their former glory, remind the what happened when Daenerys Stormborn and her dragons came to Meereen
<name="jon"> You don’t have to be here
<name="sansa"> Yes, I do
<name="ramsay"> My beloved wife I’ve missed you terribly
<name="ramsay"> Thank you for returning Lady Bolton safely Now, dismount and kneel before me, surrender your army and proclaim me the true Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North I will pardon you for deserting the Night’s Watch I will pardon these treasonous lords for betraying my house Come, bastard, you don’t have the men, you don’t have the horses, and you don’t have Winterfell Why lead those pour souls into slaughter? There’s no need for a battle Get off your hose and kneel I’m a man of mercy
<name="jon"> You’re right There’s no need for a battle Thousands of men don’t need to die Only one of us Let’s end this the old way You against me
<name="ramsay"> I keep hearing stories about you, bastard The way people in the North talk about you, you’re the greatest swordsman who ever walked Maybe you are that good Maybe not I don’t know if I’d beat you But I know that my army will beat yours I have 6,000 men You have, what, half that? Not even?
<name="jon"> Aye, you have the numbers Will your men want to fight for you when they hear you wouldn’t fight for them?
<name="ramsay"> He’s good Very good Tell me, will you let your little brother die because you’re too proud to surrender?
<name="sansa"> How do we know you have him?
<name="ramsay"> Now, if you want to save
<name="sansa"> You’re going to die tomorrow, Lord Bolton Sleep well
<name="ramsay"> She’s a fine woman, your sister I look forward to having her back in my bed And you’re all fine-looking men My dogs are desperate to meet you I haven’t fed them for seven days They’re ravenous I wonder which parts they’ll try first Your eyes? Your balls? We’ll find out soon enough In the morning, then, bastard
<name="jon"> If he was smart, he’d stay inside the walls of Winterfell and wait us out
<name="davos"> That’s not his way He knows the North is watching If the other houses sense weakness on his part, they’ll stop fearing him He can’t have that Fear is his power
<name="jon"> It’s his weakness, too His mean don’t want to fight for him They’re forced to fight for him If they feel the tide turning.
<name="tormund"> It’s not his men that worry me It’s his horses I know what mounted knights can do to us
<name="tormund"> You and Stannis cut through us like piss through snow
<name="jon"> We’re digging trenches all along our flanks They won’t be able to hit us the way that Stannis hit you, in a double envelopment TORMUND stares blankly a
<name="jon"> A pincer move
<name="jon"> They won’t be able to hit us from the sides
<name="tormund"> Good
<name="davos"> It’s crucial that we let them charge at us They’ve got the numbers, we need the patience If we let him buckle our center, he’ll pursue Then we’ll have him surrounded on three sides
<name="tormund"> Did you really think that cunt would fight you man to man?
<name="jon"> No But I wanted to make him angry I want him coming at us full tilt
<name="davos"> We should all get some sleep
<name="tormund"> Rest, Jon Snow We need you sharp tomorrow
<name="sansa"> So you’ve met the enemy, drawn up your battle plans
<name="jon"> Aye, for what they’re worth
<name="sansa"> You’ve known him for the space of a single conversation, you and your trusted advisors, and you sit around and make your plans on how to defeat a man you don’t know I lived with him I know the way his mind works I know how he likes to hurt people Did it ever once occur to you that I might have some insight?
<name="jon"> You’re right
<name="sansa"> You think he’s going to fall into your trap He won’t He’s the one who lays traps
<name="jon"> He’s overconfident
<name="sansa"> He plays with people He’s far better at it than you He’s been doing it all his life
<name="jon"> Aye, and what have I been doing all my life? Playing with broomsticks? I fought beyond the Wall against worse than Ramsay Bolton I’ve defended the Wall from worse than Ramsay Bolton
<name="sansa"> You don’t know him
<name="jon"> All right, tell me What should we do? How do we get Rickon back?
<name="sansa"> We’ll never get him back Rickon is Ned Starks trueborn son, which makes him a greater threat to Ramsay than you, a bastard, or me, a girl As long as he lives, Ramsay’s claim to Winterfell will be contested, which means he won’t live long
<name="jon"> We can’t give up on our brother
<name="sansa"> Listen to me, please He wants you to make a mistake
<name="jon"> Of course he does What should I do differently?
<name="sansa"> I don’t know! I don’t know anything about battles! Just don’t do what he wants you to do
<name="jon"> Aye, that’s good advice
<name="sansa"> You think that’s obvious?
<name="jon"> Well, it is a bit obvious
<name="sansa"> If you had asked for my advice earlier, I would have told you not to attack Winterfell until we have a larger force, or is that obvious, too?
<name="jon"> When will we have a larger force?! We’ve pleaded with every house that’ll have us! The Blackfish can’t help us! We’re lucky to have this many men
<name="sansa"> It’s not enough
<name="jon"> Now, it’s not enough! It’s what we have! Battles have been won against greater odds
<name="sansa"> If Ramsay wins, I’m not going back there alive Do you understand me? JON SNOW I won’t ever let him touch you again I’ll protect you, I promise
<name="sansa"> No one can protect me No one can protect anyone
<name="davos"> You think there’s hope?
<name="tormund"> I’ve never seen these Bolton fuckers fight And they’ve never seen the free folk fight, so, yes, there’s hope You want to avenge your king, don’t you?
<name="davos"> It wasn’t the Boltons defeated Stannis It was Stannis himself I loved the man He lifted me up and made me something But he had demons in his skull whispering foul things
<name="tormund"> You saw these demons?
<name="davos"> What?
<name="davos"> No, it’s a manner of speaking Not actual demons
<name="tormund"> Oh Well, you loved that cunt Stannis and I loved the man he burned Mance didn’t have demons in his skull He didn’t torch people or listen to some red witch I believed in him I thought he was the man to lead us through the Long Night But I was wrong just like you
<name="davos"> Maybe that was our mistake, believing in kings
<name="tormund"> Jon Snow’s not a king
<name="davos"> No, he’s not
<name="tormund"> I need a good drink to help me sleep the night before a fight You want some? I have a jug of sour goat’s milk stronger than any of that grape water you southern twats like sucking on
<name="davos"> No, thanks It does sound delicious, but I better keep a clear head I can never sleep the night before a battle
<name="tormund"> So what do you do all night?
<name="davos"> I walk Think and walk Think and walk until I’m far enough away from camp that no one can hear me shitting my guts out
<name="tormund"> Happy shitting
<name="jon"> My lady You weren’t at the war council
<name="melisandre"> I’m not a soldier
<name="jon"> Any advice?
<name="melisandre"> Don’t lose
<name="jon"> If I do, if I fall, don’t bring me back
<name="melisandre"> I’ll have to try
<name="jon"> I’m ordering you not to bring me back
<name="melisandre"> I am not your servant, Jon Snow
<name="jon"> You’re in my camp I’m the commander
<name="melisandre"> I serve the Lord of Light I do what he commands
<name="jon"> How do you know what he commands?
<name="melisandre"> I interpret his signs as well as I can If the Lord didn’t want me to bring you back, how did I bring you back? I have no power Only what he gives me and he gave me you
<name="jon"> Why?
<name="melisandre"> I don’t know Maybe you’re only needed for this small part of his plan and nothing else Maybe he brought you here to die again
<name="jon"> What kind of god would do something like that?
<name="melisandre"> The one we’ve got
<name="tyrion"> Last time we saw each other was at Winterfell, yes? You were making jokes about my height, I seem to recall Everyone who makes a joke about a dwarf’s height thinks he’s the only person ever to make a joke about a dwarf’s height The height of nobility,” a man of your stature,” someone to look up to.” You’re all making the same five or six jokes
<name="theon"> It was a long time ago
<name="tyrion"> It was And how have things been going for you since then? Not so well, I gather Can’t imagine you would have murdered the Stark boys if things had been going well
<name="theon"> I didn’t murder the Stark boys But I did things that were just as bad or worse
<name="yara"> And he paid for them
<name="tyrion"> Doesn’t seem like it He’s still alive It was complicated for you, I’m sure, growing up at Winterfell Never quite knowing who you were But then, we all live complicated lives, don’t we?
<name="daenerys"> You’ve brought us 100 ships from the Iron Fleet with men to sail them In return, I expect you want me to support your claim to the throne of the Iron Islands?
<name="theon"> Not my claim Hers
<name="daenerys"> And what’s wrong with you?
<name="theon"> I’m not fit to rule
<name="tyrion"> We can agree upon that at least
<name="daenerys"> Has the Iron Islands ever had a queen before?
<name="yara"> No more than Westeros
<name="theon"> Our Uncle Euron returned home after a long absence He murdered our father and took the Salt Throne from yara He would have murdered us if we had stayed
<name="daenerys"> Lord Tyrion tells me your father was a terrible king
<name="yara"> You and I have that in common
<name="daenerys"> We do And both murdered by a usurper as well
<name="daenerys"> Will their ships be enough?
<name="tyrion"> With the former Masters’ fleet, possibly Barely There are more than 100 ships in the Iron Fleet
<name="theon"> There are and Euron is building more He’s going to offer them to you
<name="daenerys"> So why shouldn’t I wait for him?
<name="theon"> The Iron Fleet isn’t all he’s bringing He also wants to give you -
<name="yara"> His big cock, I think he said Euron’s offer is also an offer of marriage, you see You won’t get one without the other
<name="daenerys"> And I imagine your offer is free of any marriage demands?
<name="yara"> I never demand, but I’m up for anything, really
<name="theon"> He murdered our father and would have murdered us He’ll murder you as soon as you have what he wants
<name="tyrion"> The Seven Kingdoms
<name="theon"> All of them
<name="daenerys"> And you don’t want the Seven Kingdoms?
<name="theon"> Your ancestors defeated ours and took the Iron Islands We ask you to give them back
<name="daenerys"> And that’s all?
<name="yara"> We’d like you to help us murder an uncle or two who don’t think a woman’s fit to rule
<name="daenerys"> Reasonable
<name="tyrion"> What if everyone starts demanding their independence?
<name="daenerys"> She’s not demanding, she’s asking The others are free to ask as well Our father were evil men, all of us here They left the world worse than they found it We’re not going to do that We’re going to leave the world better than we found it
<name="daenerys"> You will support my claim as queen of the Seven Kingdoms and respect the integrity of the Seven Kingdoms No more reaving, roving, raiding, or raping
<name="yara"> That’s our way of life
<name="daenerys"> No more
<name="yara"> No more
<name="ramsay"> Do you like games, little man? Let’s play a game Run to your brother The sooner you make it to him, the sooner you get to see him That’s it That’s the game Easy Ready? Go
<name="ramsay"> No, you have to run, remember? Those are the rules
<name="tormund"> Don’t
<name="davos"> Prepare to charge! Prepare to charge
<name="davos"> Go! Go! Follow your commander
<name="tormund"> Run and fight
<name="ramsay"> Now
<name="kar"> Cavalry, charge
<name="davos"> We’ll just kill our own men Stand down
<name="ramsay"> Loose
<name="jon"> Get word -
<name="davos"> We may as well be taking shits back here
<name="davos"> Follow
<name="ramsay"> It’s time, go
<name="smalljon"> Who owns the North?
<name="all"> We do
<name="smalljon"> Who owns the North?
<name="all"> We do
<name="smalljon"> Show me
<name="tormund"> Hey
<name="man"> Infantry, advance
<name="davos"> With me, lads! Break their line
<name="man"> Tormund
<name="man"> Get him back
<name="tormund"> Fuck this, come on
<name="ramsay"> Their army’s gone
<name="man"> Our army’s gone
<name="ramsay"> We have Winterfell They don’t have the men for a siege All we have to do is wait
<name="ramsay"> You suggested one on one combat, didn’t you?
<name="ramsay"> I’ve reconsidered I think that sounds like a wonderful idea
<name="jon"> We’re going to bury my brother in the crypt next to my father
<name="sansa"> Jon
<name="sansa"> Where is he?
<name="ramsay"> Ah Sansa Hello, Sansa Is this where I’ll be staying now? No Our time together is about to come to an end That’s all right You can’t kill me I’m part of you now
<name="sansa"> Your words will disappear Your house will disappear Your name will disappear All memory of you will disappear
<name="ramsay"> My hounds will never harm me
<name="sansa"> You haven’t fed them in seven days You said it yourself
<name="ramsay"> They’re loyal beasts
<name="sansa"> They were Now they’re starving
<name="ramsay"> Sit Down Down Down Down Down

<name="meera"> I’m so sorry
<name="rider"> Come with me, now
<name="rider"> The dead don’t rest
<name="gilly"> It’s so green
<name="sam"> Oh, yes Once you get south of the Riverlands, very different sorts of trees start to take over Maple, elm, beech, poplar The odd willow And of course now that summer’s over, you’ll start seeing the autumn colors coming in Still, you’ll find more green here than anywhere else
<name="gilly"> You’re nervous You’re a nervous talker
<name="gilly"> That’s not any better being a nervous mute
<name="sam"> I didn’t think I’d ever come back here after my father made me renounce my title and inheritance and, well, threaten to kill me if I didn’t A person just doesn’t feel welcome at that point
<name="sam"> And I certainly didn’t expect to be introducing him to my family So you know what to tell them
<name="gilly"> That Little Sam is your baby
<name="sam"> Yes, now that’s very important If he thinks that Little Sam is his grandchild, he’ll take you in He’ll get an education He’ll learn to read And you can help teach him Huh?
<name="gilly"> What did you tell your family about me?
<name="sam"> I told them I met you in the North
<name="gilly"> Did you tell them how far north?
<name="sam"> Well, it wasn’t a very large piece of parchment
<name="gilly"> You didn’t tell them where I’m really from? You didn’t tell them I’m a wildling?
<name="sam"> The thing is my father doesn’t like wildlings He hoped I’d make a man of myself by killing some bloody wildlings,” so it’s probably a good subject to avoid if at all possible
<name="gilly"> I think we’re here
<name="melessa"> Sam Oh, Sam
<name="sam"> Oh, hello, Mother
<name="melessa"> I never thought I’d see you again You look wonderful

<name="tommen"> Is there no other way?
<name="high sparrow"> You’re afraid for her?
<name="tommen"> Of course I’m afraid for her! It just seems very dangerous
<name="high sparrow"> She’ll be protected the entire way The Faith Militant are very stern with those who overstep their bounds And Queen Margaery isn’t your mother I suspect the gods will predispose the common people to gentleness on her behalf She’s truly opened her heart to them
<name="tommen"> She’s always been very devoted to the poor and the unfortunate
<name="high sparrow"> And now she’s devoted to the gods as well Would you like to see her?
<name="tommen"> Have they hurt you? Have they mistreated you?
<name="margaery"> No, Your Grace
<name="tommen"> I’ve missed you More than you could know

<name="tommen"> Yes, a few times Have you?
<name="margaery"> Yes, I have He’s not quite what we thought he was, is he?
<name="margaery"> You think I’m mad I sound mad
<name="tommen"> No No, you don’t You you could never You’re right, he’s not He’s a lot more-
<name="margaery"> He is There’s something about him His way of looking at the world It’s not an easy thing admitting to yourself what you really are It’s taken me a while He’s helped me
<name="tommen"> What are you talking about? You’re a good person You’ve always been a good person You’re the best person I know
<name="tommen"> I was just telling him about your devotion to the poor
<name="margaery"> Ah, yes, I visited their hovels and I fed them soup and I made sure I was seen doing it I never gave them what they really needed, though I’ve had lots of time to think about how good I was at seeming good All those stories I told myself about who I was and why I did the things I did There were so many lies in those stories
<name="tommen"> I don’t understand
<name="margaery"> It’s all right It really is It’s such a relief to let go of those lies
<name="tommen"> What about Loras?
<name="margaery"> I love my brother I will always love my brother His soul is pure and perfect His sins don’t erase that purity, they only obscure it He just needs to atone for them We all do Sooner or later, one way or another The gods have a plan for us all
<name="gilly"> It’s hard to walk in this
<name="sam"> It’s beautiful You’re beautiful
<name="sam"> This venison, it’s very tasty Is it from today’s hunt?
<name="dickon"> Well, no We haven’t been able to cure that one yet This is last week’s
<name="sam"> Oh, of course Sorry Long journey
<name="dickon"> Brought it down from 70 yards One shot
<name="sam"> Oh, that’s a fair distance
<name="dickon"> So do you do much hunting up at the wall?
<name="sam"> Oh, yes Yes A good amount North of the Wall, you don’t hunt, you don’t eat
<name="dickon"> Mm-hmmm Mostly deer or is it elk as well?
<name="sam"> Rabbits Sometimes squirrels I say we,” it’s my friend Jon mostly Sometimes Edd Oh, and Gilly She’s she’s quite a good hunter as well Um, huntress
<name="melessa"> I imagine it’s common where you’re from We once met a man, Lord Umber from Last Hearth, wasn’t it, Randyll, who said he taught all his daughters how to hunt
<name="talla"> Your father taught you to hunt? Our father would never teach us I think our father could learn a thing or two from your father
<name="randyll"> That’s enough of that
<name="melessa"> Samwell, would you care for more bread?
<name="sam"> Oh, yes Yes, please Thank you, Mother
<name="randyll"> Not fat enough already?
<name="sam"> I travelled south under orders from the Lord Commander He wants me to-
<name="randyll"> I read your letter You’re to be a maester
<name="sam"> Yes And once I have my chain, I’ll return to Castle Black
<name="randyll"> I thought the Night’s Watch might make a man of you Something resembling a man at least You managed to stay soft and fat
<name="randyll"> Your nose buried in books Spending your life reading about the achievements of better men I’ll wager you still can’t sit a horse or wield a sword
<name="melessa"> Randyll, to be maester of the Night’s Watch is a great honor
<name="gilly"> He can wield a sword He killed a Thenn He killed a White Walker
<name="dickon"> There’s no such thing
<name="gilly"> I saw it with my own eyes on our way down to Castle Black He drove a dagger into the walker’s heart He risked his own life to save mine more than once He’s a greater warrior than either of you will ever be
<name="randyll"> Your way down to Castle Black? Where did he kill a white walker? Where are you from? How’d you come to meet my son?
<name="gilly"> The Night’s Watch came to our keep
<name="randyll"> Where?

<name="izembaro"> That crowd was shit
<name="lady crane"> Girl
<name="lady crane"> What are you doing back here?
<name="arya"> Nothing
<name="lady crane"> I saw you the other day in the audience How many times have you seen this stupid play?
<name="arya"> Three times
<name="lady crane"> Did you pay?
<name="arya"> No
<name="lady crane"> I remember when the players came to my village I didn’t have any money, so I snuck in Just like you Saw the painted faces, the costumes, listened to the songs, cried when the young lovers died in each other’s arms I ran off and joined them the next day, never looked back
<name="arya"> You’re very good
<name="lady crane"> My final speech is shit
<name="lady crane"> But to be fair to myself, which I always like to be, the writing’s no good
<name="arya"> So change it It would all just be farting, belching, and slapping without you
<name="lady crane"> How would you change it?
<name="arya"> The queen loves her son more than anything And he was taken from her before she could say good-bye She wouldn’t just cry She would be angry She would want to kill the person who did this to her
<name="lady crane"> What’s your name?
<name="arya"> Mercy
<name="lady crane"> You have very expressive eyes, Mercy
<name="lady crane"> Wonderful eyebrows Do you like pretending to be other people?
<name="arya"> I have to go My father’s waiting for me
<name="bianca"> Lady Crane, they loved you
<name="lady crane"> They were sweet Or drunk Drunkenly sweet
<name="izembaro"> No laugh for Ned’s death These people are worse than animals
<name="izembaro"> But they loved her They all love her
<name="camello"> Yes, you are adored by people and animals alike
<name="lady crane"> I do what I can with what I’m given
<name="izembaro"> With what you’re given?
<name="lady crane"> Well, I was thinking-
<name="izembaro"> Oh, we’re all thinkers now, are we?
<name="izembaro"> Full to the tits with ideas
<name="lady crane"> I didn’t mean-
<name="izembaro"> You have ideas, I have ideas, he has ideas Why should my ideas have any more value than yours simply because I’ve been doing this my whole life? Who is anyone to judge my work? This is my profession I know what I’m doing
<name="izembaro"> You have no right to an opinion
<name="arya"> Careful of that one She wants you dead
<name="jaqen"> And?
<name="waif"> As I expected
<name="jaqen"> A shame A girl had many gifts
<name="waif"> You promised me
<name="jaqen"> Don’t let her suffer
<name="mace"> My lord
<name="jaime"> My lord
<name="mace"> My friends, the hour has come Madness has overtaken this city and grasped in its claws my children But now we must drive it back under the rocks whence it came Madness has had its day
<name="captain"> Forward, march
<name="high sparrow"> Rich or poor, noble or common, if we win, we must atone Margaery of House Tyrell came to us a sinner She stood before the gods in the holy sept and lied She turned a blind eye to her brother’s sins She disgraces her house, the king, and herself
<name="captain"> Company, halt! Face front! Turn
<name="high sparrow"> Lord Tyrell
<name="high sparrow"> Ser Jaime
<name="jaime"> Sorry to interrupt We’re here for Queen Margaery and Ser Loras Tyrell Give them to us and we’ll be on our way
<name="high sparrow"> I don’t have the authority to give them to you And you don’t have the authority to take them
<name="captain"> Lock spears
<name="jaime"> I speak for King Tommen of House Baratheon, First of His Name
<name="high sparrow"> The gods don’t recognize his authority in this matter
<name="jaime"> You already insulted one great house It won’t happen twice Every last sparrow will die before Margaery walks down that street
<name="high sparrow"> To die in the service of the gods would please each and every one of us We yearn for it But there is no call for it today There will be no walk of atonement
<name="captain"> Order up
<name="high sparrow"> Queen Margaery has already atoned for her sins by bringing another into the true light of the Seven
<name="high sparrow"> Together we announce a new age of harmony A holy alliance between the Crown and the Faith
<name="woman"> Long live King Tommen and bless you, Queen Margaery
<name="tommen"> The crown and the faith are the twin pillars upon which the world rests Together we will restore the Seven Kingdoms to glory
<name="mace"> What’s happening?
<name="olenna"> He’s beaten us That’s what’s happening
<name="tommen"> When you attack the Faith, you attack the Crown Anyone who attacks the Crown is unfit to serve as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard
<name="jaime"> I’ve been a member of the Kingsguard since before you were born You don’t have to do this You don’t have to do anything
<name="tommen"> I have to answer to the gods
<name="jaime"> Not when you’re sitting in that chair
<name="tommen"> The Crown’s decision on this matter is final
<name="jaime"> Will I be walking naked in the streets? Or will I spend a few months in the sept dungeons first to teach me about the gods’ mercy?
<name="tommen"> You have served your house and your king faithfully for many years And you will continue to do so But not in this city
<name="walder"> You’ve lost it?
<name="black walder"> Yes, father
<name="walder"> It’s a castle, not a bloody sheep Presumably you still know where it is You didn’t lose Riverrun You let the Blackfish take it from you
<name="lothar"> He surprised us He knows the castle better than anyone
<name="walder"> You did lose the Blackfish after the Red Wedding You had him right here in this hall and you let him leave Then when I told you to hunt him down and kill him, you couldn’t find him That’s what it means to lose something Now he’s come back and taken Riverrun
<name="black walder"> I don’t think it’s fair to blame us-
<name="walder"> For 300 years we kissed Tully boots, swore oaths to them and their stinking fish banners Not again Riverrun is ours Take it back
<name="black walder"> We don’t have the men
<name="walder"> We’ve got 10 times as many men as the damn Blackfish
<name="black walder"> The Mallisters have risen against us And the Blackwoods
<name="lothar"> The Brotherhood Without Banners is rallying the commoners against us, raiding our supply trains and camps
<name="black walder"> Riverrun can withstand a siege for a year
<name="walder"> If I want excuses, I’ll put her in charge They’re laughing at us All across the Riverlands right down to King’s Landing, they’re laughing at us
<name="walder"> I hear it in my sleep! I’m not dead yet, unfortunately for you And I’ll not leave this world until they all choke on that laughter Take that castle back
<name="lothar"> He’ll never yield, Father
<name="walder"> Oh, he’ll yield
<name="walder"> You’ll show him the knife you used to kill Robb Stark’s child in his whore mother’s belly, and you’ll show him the knife you used to open his niece’s throat And you’ll remind him who it was that got married at the Red Wedding in the first place His nephew
<name="walder"> Cheer up, Lord Edmure You’re going home
<name="jaime"> I’m being sent to deal with the Blackfish Apparently Walder Frey can’t manage it on his own because he’s 400 years old Sent me with an army to the Riverlands and a siege that could last months
<name="cersei"> BEtter you’re elsewhere at the head of an army than in the sept dungeons
<name="jaime"> I’m not going to the Riverlands
<name="cersei"> What, then?
<name="jaime"> I’m going to give Bronn the largest bag of gold anyone’s ever seen and have him gather the best killers he knows I’ll take them to the sept and I’ll remove the High Sparrow’s head and every other sparrow head I can find
<name="cersei"> You can’t
<name="jaime"> He has our son! He stole our son! He’s torn our family apart How should we treat people who tear us apart?
<name="cersei"> We should treat them without mercy and we will But if you kill the High Sparrow, you won’t leave the sept alive And without you, this is all for nothing Stand at the head of our army where you belong, where Father wanted you Show our men where their loyalties belong Show them what lannisters are, what we do to our enemies And take that stupid little castle back because it’s ours and because you can
<name="jaime"> You’ll stand trial soon I need to he here for you
<name="cersei"> It will be a trial by combat I have the Mountain They’ve made us both stronger, all of them
<name="cersei"> They have no idea how strong we are No idea what we’re going to do to them
<name="cersei"> We’ve always been together We’ll always be together We’re the only two people in the world
<name="meera"> Why did you help us?
<name="rider"> The Three-Eyed Raven sent for me
<name="meera"> The Three-Eyed Raven’s dead
<name="rider"> Now he lives again
<name="rider"> When I last saw you, you were a boy A fearless boy Loved to climb the castle walls, frighten his mother
<name="bran"> Who are you?
<name="bran"> Uncle Benjen The last letter Jon wrote me said you had been lost beyond the Wall
<name="benjen"> I led a ranging party deep into the North to find White Walkers They found us A white walker stabbed me in the gut with a sword of ice Left me there to die To turn The Children found me Stopped the walker’s magic from taking hold
<name="bran"> How?
<name="benjen"> The same way they made the Walkers in the first place You saw it yourself
<name="bran"> Dragonglass A shard of dragonglass plunged into your heart
<name="benjen"> You are the Three-Eyed Raven now
<name="bran"> I didn’t have time to learn I can’t control anything
<name="benjen"> You must learn to control it before the Night King comes
<name="benjen"> Drink
<name="benjen"> One way or another, he will find his way to the world of men When he does, you will be there waiting for him And you will be ready
<name="daario"> Everything all right?
<name="daenerys"> How many days’ ride to Meereen?
<name="daario"> A week at best
<name="daenerys"> How many ships will I need to bring my khalasar to Westeros?
<name="daario"> Dothraki and all their horses, the Unsullied, the Second Sons 1,000 ships easily Probably more
<name="daenerys"> And who has that many?
<name="daario"> Nobody
<name="daenerys"> Nobody yet
<name="daario"> So we ride for Meereen and after that we sail for Westeros What then?
<name="daenerys"> I take what is mine
<name="daario"> You weren’t made to sit on a chair in a palance
<name="daenerys"> What was I made for?
<name="daario"> You’re a conqueror, Daenerys Stormborn
<name="daenerys"> Wait here
<name="daario"> I’m going after her Wait for me here
<name="daenerys"> Every khal who ever lived chose three blood riders to fight beside him and guard his way But I am not a khal I will not choose three blood riders I choose you all
<name="daenerys"> I will ask more of you than any khal has ever asked of his khalassar! Will you ride the wooden horses across the black salt sea?
<name="daenerys"> Will you kill my enemies in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses?
<name="daenerys"> Will you give me the Seven Kingdoms, the gift Khal Drogo promised me before the Mother of Mountains?
<name="daenerys"> Are you with me?
<name="daenerys"> Now and always?

<name="jon"> With the peas and onions?
<name="sansa"> Mmm
<name="jon"> We never should have left Winterfell
<name="sansa"> Don’t you wish we could go back to the day we left? I want to scream at myself, Don’t go, you idiot
<name="jon"> How could we know?
<name="sansa"> I spent a lot of time thinking about what as ass I was to you I wish I could change everything
<name="jon"> We were children
<name="sansa"> I was awful, just admit it
<name="jon"> You were occasionally awful I’m sure I can’t have been great fun Always sulking in the corner while the rest of you played
<name="sansa"> Can you forgive me?
<name="jon"> There’s nothing to forgive
<name="sansa"> Forgive me
<name="jon"> All right All right, I forgive you
<name="jon"> You’d think after thousands of years, the Night’s Watch would have learned how to make a good ale
<name="sansa"> Where will you go?
<name="jon"> Where will we go? If I don’t watch over you, Father’s ghost will come back and murder me
<name="sansa"> Where will we go?
<name="jon"> I can’t stay here, not after what happened
<name="sansa"> There’s only one place we can go Home
<name="jon"> Should we tell the Boltons to pack up and leave?
<name="sansa"> We’ll take it back from them
<name="jon"> I don’t have an army
<name="sansa"> How many wildlings did you save?
<name="jon"> They didn’t come here to serve me
<name="sansa"> They owe you their lives
<name="sansa"> You think they’ll be safe here if Roose Bolton remains Warden of the North?
<name="jon"> Sansa
<name="sansa"> Winterfell is our home It’s ours and Arya’s and Bran’s and Rickon’s Wherever they are, it belongs to our family We have to fight for it
<name="jon"> I’m tired of fighting
<name="jon"> It’s all I’ve done since I left home I’ve killed brothers of the Night’s Watch I’ve killed wildlings I’ve killed men that I admire I hanged a boy younger than Bran I fought and I lost
<name="sansa"> If we don’t take back the North, we’ll never be safe I want you to help me But I’ll do it myself if I have to
<name="davos"> My lady
<name="melisandre"> Ser Davos
<name="davos"> Will you stay here at Castle Black?
<name="melisandre"> I will do as Jon Snow commands
<name="davos"> You serve Jon Snow now?
<name="melisandre"> He’s the prince that was promised
<name="davos"> Forgive me, my lady, I thought that was Stannis
<name="davos"> What happened down there?
<name="melisandre"> There was a battle Stannis was defeated
<name="davos"> And Shireen? What happened to the princess?
<name="brienne"> I saw what happened I saw Stannis’ forces defeated in the field
<name="davos"> My lady, I’m Ser Davos Seaworth
<name="brienne"> We’ve met before I was Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon Before Renly was assassinated with bloodmagic
<name="davos"> That’s in the past now
<name="brienne"> Yes, it’s in the past It doesn’t mean I forget Or forgive He admitted it, you know
<name="davos"> Who did?
<name="brienne"> Stannis Just before I executed him
<name="littlefinger"> The Defender of the Vale
<name="robin"> Uncle Petyr
<name="littlefinger"> My lord Come and see
<name="littlefinger"> I missed your name day Go on
<name="robin"> A falcon
<name="littlefinger"> A gyrfalcon The greatest and rarest of birds
<name="yohn royce"> Last time I saw you, Baelish, you told me you were taking Sansa Stark home with you to the Fingers
<name="littlefinger"> Indeed I was
<name="yohn royce"> And yet not long ago, we received reports that she has been married to Ramsay Bolton in Winterfell
<name="littlefinger"> On our way to the Fingers, we were set upon by a large force of Bolton men Seemed to know exactly when we were traveling and exactly whom we were transporting
<name="yohn royce"> Do you take me for a fool?
<name="littlefinger"> Tell me, Lord Royce, how many people knew of my travel plans with Sansa Stark? I shared my intentions with you and no one else
<name="yohn royce"> Slander a man in his own home, you might find yourself crossing swords with him
<name="littlefinger"> Your home is the Vale The Lord of the Vale stands before us And only his judgment concerns me
<name="robin"> Shall we throw him through the Moon Door?
<name="yohn royce"> My lord My lord, I have always been faithful to House Arryn To your father, to your mother, and now to you
<name="robin"> Do you believe him, Uncle Petyr?
<name="littlefinger"> Lord Royce has served the Vale well He;s enjoyed a distinguished military career If we could trust his absolute loyalty, he would make a capable commander in the wars to come
<name="yohn royce"> You can trust my absolute loyalty, my lord
<name="littlefinger"> I think he deserves one more chance What do you say?
<name="robin"> Fine
<name="littlefinger"> I bring good news My friends in the North tell me Sansa has escaped Winterfell I expect she’s headed to Castle Black where her brother serves as Lord Commander But she won’t be safe there, not with the Boltons after her
<name="robin"> She’s my cousin We should help her
<name="littlefinger"> That was my instinct as well
<name="littlefinger"> Our lord has spoken Gather the Knights of the Vale The time has come to join the fray
<name="grey worm"> You invite the enemy into our city?
<name="tyrion"> I did As a clever man once told me, We make peace with our enemies, not our friends
<name="grey worm"> I don’t make peace with the queen’s enemies I kill the queen’s enemies
<name="tyrion"> Yes, that’s the military approach And how has that worked here in Meereen? I represent the diplomatic approach
<name="missandei"> Our queen tried to make peace with the Masters and they tried to murder her TYRION We enter these negotiations with open eyes Trust me My own recent experience with slavery has taught me the horrors of that institution
<name="missandei"> How many days were you a slave?
<name="tyrion"> Long enough to know
<name="missandei"> Not long enough to understand
<name="yezzan"> I bought this dwarf for a single gold honor And somehow you’ve risen to the top of the Great Pyramid of Meereen It’s most impressive
<name="tyrion"> And now you speak for the Good Masters of Astapor.Here’s to reversals of fortune
<name="razdal"> We came here to meet the queen and instead we’re greeted by a dwarf and a eunuch
<name="tyrion"> Let’s make this simple, shall we? Tell me what you want
<name="belicho"> We want you to leave Slaver’s Bay Take your dragons and your mercenaries and go
<name="tyrion"> Queen Daenerys won’t stay in Meereen forever Her path takes her westward
<name="razdal"> When we last met, I offered her ships so she could return to Westeros where she belongs She refused them
<name="missandei"> She refused them because hundreds of thousands of men, women, and children still lived in chains
<name="razdal"> As they have since the dawn of time
<name="grey worm"> Not anymore
<name="yezzan"> You think you’re a free man now? You still follow orders Just because your master has silver hair and tits doesn’t mean she’s not a master
<name="tyrion"> Friends, friends, friends, please
<name="tyrion"> There have always been those with wealth and power and those with nothing That is the way of the world I’m not here to change the way of the world
<name="yezzan"> Slavery is the way of our world
<name="tyrion"> You don’t need slaves to make money There haven’t been slaves in Westeros for hundreds of years and I grew up richer than any of you But our queen recognizes that she erred by abolishing slavery without providing a new system to replace it So here is the queen’s proposal Slavery will never return to Meereen but she will give the other cities of Slaver’s Bay time to adjust to the new order
<name="yezzan"> What does that mean?
<name="tyrion"> Instead of abolishing slavery overnight, we will give you seven years to end the practice
<name="tyrion"> Slaveholders will be compensated for their losses, of course, at fair prices In exchange, you will cut off your support for the Sons of the Harpy
<name="yezzan"> We do not support the Sons of the Harpy
<name="tyrion"> Fine, fine, but you will cut it off all the same I do hope you accept, my friends You will not receive a better offer
<name="tyrion"> Let us sail on the tide of freedom instead of being drowned by it And as a parting gift to our honored guests
<name="tyrion"> Give freedom a chance See if it doesn’t taste every bit as good as what came before
<name="tyrion"> My friends! Large sorry you wait so fat time
<name="missandei"> Perhaps I should translate for you
<name="man"> We speak the Common Tongue
<name="tyrion"> Excellent
<name="man"> You met with the slavers today
<name="tyrion"> I did
<name="man"> Our brothers and sister died fighting these scum Now you invite them to our city and drink wine with them
<name="tyrion"> I imagine this room was built so the rulers could intimidate the ruled
<name="tyrion"> But I am not your ruler I’m not the Breaker of Chains I’m not the Unburnt And I am certainly not the Mother of Dragons
<name="man"> You are a stranger here So why do you represent Meereen in these talks with our enemies?
<name="tyrion"> Because our queen chose me as her advisor Until she returns from her travels -
<name="man"> When does she return?
<name="tyrion"> Soon You have my word
<name="man"> We don’t know you We don’t trust you We know Torgo Nudho We fight with him against the Masters We trust him
<name="tyrion"> And that is exactly why Grey Worm took part in these negotiations As commander of the Unsullied, he knows hot to defeat the slavers and he knows when it is time to make peace
<name="man"> You have made peace with the slavers?
<name="tyrion"> We offered terms
<name="man"> And you, Grey Worm? You want to drink wine with these men? The men who tore us from our mothers’ arms and sold us at auction like cattle?
<name="grey worm"> I am a soldier, not a politician But if there is a chance for peace a just peace we should take it
<name="man"> Missandei, you know what these men are How can you trust them?
<name="missandei"> I do not trust them I will never trust them
<name="missandei"> But as a wise man once said, We make peace with our enemies, not our friends
<name="grey worm"> Do not use me for your lies
<name="tyrion"> Those men respect you
<name="grey worm"> They respect me because they know who I am They know I am loyal
<name="tyrion"> As do I
<name="grey worm"> I am loyal to my queen, not you If you betray her work, you are my enemy
<name="tyrion"> I am not betraying her work I am trying to save her city
<name="missandei"> You promised the slavers they could keep slavery
<name="tyrion"> For a short time
<name="missandei"> Seven years is not a short time for a slave
<name="tyrion"> You’re right Slavery is a horror that should be ended at once War is a horror that should be ended at once I can’t do both today
<name="grey worm"> You are wrong to trust these men
<name="tyrion"> I don’t trust the Masters I trust their self-interest They’re trustworthy if they’re convinced that working with me is in their self-interest
<name="grey worm"> You don’t know them You don’t understand them We are not human in their eyes They look at me and see a weapon They look at her and see a whore
<name="tyrion"> They look at me and they see a misshapen little beast Their contempt is their weakness They’ll underestimate us every time and we will use that to our advantage
<name="grey worm"> You will not use them They will use you That is what they do
<name="daario"> You all right? Why don’t you sit and catch your breath?
<name="jorah"> I’m fine
<name="daario"> I don’t think you could ride the dragon 20 years ago, maybe
<name="jorah"> What?

<name="daario"> Must make you angry that our queen chose me
<name="jorah"> Makes me sad You’ll disappoint her before long She’ll move on
<name="daario"> We’ll all disappoint her before long
<name="jorah"> We need each other right now After we’re done needing each other -
<name="daario"> Oh, I don’t want to fight you, Jorah the Andal What do I have to gain? If I win, I’m the shit who killed an old man If I lose, I’m the shit who was killed by an old man
<name="jorah"> You didn’t get much discipline as a child, did you?
<name="daario"> None
<name="jorah"> The road running through the Horse Gate, they call that the godsway
<name="jorah"> Eastern Market, Western Market When Khal Drogo died, she was supposed to come here and join the Dosh Khaleen, the widows of the dead khals That’s where they would have taken her, the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen
<name="daario"> What are you doing?
<name="jorah"> It’s forbidden to carry weapons in the sacred city
<name="daario"> Isn’t it forbidden to sneak into their city and steal their khaleesi?
<name="jorah"> If they spot us and we’re unarmed, we’ll say we’re traders heading for the Western Market But if they see weapons
<name="daario"> You’re asking a dog to hand over his teeth
<name="jorah"> There’s 100,000 of them down there We can’t fight our way out We wait till dark, and then we’ll find her
<name="darrio"> Uh
<name="daario"> I’m very attached to this knife
<name="jorah"> Don’t worry it didn’t touch you
<name="daario"> You know what happens?
<name="jorah"> I know what happens
<name="daario"> I’ll do it myself
<name="daario"> I should have been born a Dothraki
<name="jorah"> Come on
<name="jorah"> My friends We wandered off from the Western Market and got lost Could you show us the way back?
<name="dothraki"> What do you sell?
<name="jorah"> Wine Come down to my stall tomorrow, I’ll give you a cask of the Arbor’s finest
<name="dothraki"> You’re not merchants
<name="dothraki"> Get the others
<name="daario"> Told you, I’m very attached to this knife
<name="daario"> You all right?
<name="jorah"> If they find a body with a stab wound, the whole city will be looking for us
<name="daario"> Huh
<name="leader"> Some of them don’t think Dothraki should breed with foreigners They are stupid old women They don’t realize that we have always diluted our blood This one is Lhazareen Her Khal found her hiding in a well after he burned her village How old were you?
<name="lhazareen woman"> Twelve
<name="leader"> A year later, she bore her Khal a daughter How did he show his happiness?
<name="lhazareen woman"> He broke my ribs
<name="leader"> We are not queens here, but the khals depend on us for our wisdom Our lives have meaning
<name="daenerys"> That is more than most have
<name="leader"> When the khals meet for the Khalar Vezhven tomorrow night, I hope they let you live out your days with us The other possibilities are not so pleasant
<name="daenerys"> I need to make water
<name="leader"> You can’t run from Dothraki You know this
<name="daenerys"> I will never run from Dothraki
<name="leader"> Go, show her
<name="daenerys"> I needed fresh air The old women stink
<name="lhazareen woman"> They do stink
<name="daenerys"> You must have been very young when your Khal died
<name="lhazareen woman"> Sixteen
<name="daenerys"> Too bad he didn’t die sooner
<name="lhazareen woman"> Yes, too bad
<name="lhazareen woman"> Is it true you have three dragons?
<name="daenerys"> Mm-hmm
<name="lhazareen woman"> And they breathe fire?
<name="daenerys"> They do Would you like to see them one day?
<name="lhazareen woman"> I am Dosh Khaleen I can never leave Vaes Dothrak, until I rise as smoke from the pyre on the day I die
<name="daenerys"> No, don’t hurt her
<name="daario"> She’ll give us away
<name="jorah"> We have to go now
<name="daenerys"> We will never get out of Vaes Dothrak alive
<name="jorah"> All we can do is try
<name="daenerys"> No We can do more than that And you’re going to help me
<name="daenerys"> And you Have faith in me, Khaleesi Do not betray me
<name="high sparrow"> If I were to let you leave right now, where would you go? What would you seek out?
<name="margaery"> I’d go to my brother, my husband, my family
<name="high sparrow"> Of course, but for you, that means seeking out money, finery, power Seeking out your family means seeking out sin I’m not maligning you I sought those things out, too To the exclusion of all else My father was a cobbler He died with I was young and I took over his shop He was a simple man and he made simple shoes But I found that the more work I put into my shoes, the more people wanted them Fine leather, ornamentation, detailing, and time Time most of all Dozens of hours spent on a single pair
<name="margaery"> Quality takes time
<name="high sparrow"> Yes I imagine you’ve worn a year of someone’s life on your back The highborn liked to cover their feet with my time and they paid well for the privilege I used their money to buy a taste of their lives for myself Each time I indulged, I felt myself ascending to something better
<name="margaery"> And one day you walked through a graveyard and realized it was all for nothing and set out on the path to righteousness Book of the Stranger, verse 25
<name="high sparrow"> You know
<name="margaery"> Septa Unella reads it to me At me
<name="high sparrow"> Yes, yes, she does enjoy reading at people You’re close But it wasn’t a graveyard It was a feast I bought old fine wine and young pretty girls and invited my friends to come share it all We passed around the wine, passed around the women, and soon we fell into a stupor I woke before dawn I could barely stand Everyone else was asleep on the couches or on the floor, lying in heaps next to their fine clothes The truth of their bodies laid bare I could smell them beneath the incense and the perfume and the fine food that had already started to turn And I saw it with perfect clarity I saw what my sins were The gold I had, the wine I drank, the women I used, my ceaseless struggle to maintain my position It was all part of a story A story I was telling myself about who I was A collection of lies that would disappear in the light The people I was trying to climb away from, the beggars in the street, the poor, they were closer to the truth than I ever was
<name="margaery"> So what did you do?
<name="high sparrow"> I left to go and find them I didn’t even put on my shoes I walked out the door and never went back
<name="high sparrow"> Come, let’s go and see him
<name="margaery"> Who?
<name="high sparrow"> Your brother
<name="margaery"> Loras Loras
<name="margaery"> Listen to me You need to stay strong
<name="loras"> I can’t stay strong I never was strong
<name="margaery"> You are strong You are the future of our house, the future of our family
<name="loras"> I don’t care about that
<name="margaery"> Shh Have you have you told them that? That you don’t care?
<name="loras"> I just want it to stop Help me
<name="margaery"> They want me to help you They want me told help tear you down That’s why he’s letting me see you, I know it is And if either of us give in to what they want, then they win
<name="loras"> Let them win Just make it stop Please
<name="margaery"> All right
<name="maester pycelle"> And now, how to avert disaster with our current predicament This High Sparrow I have dealt with fanatics of every description, Your Grace Not setting them off, that’s the most important thing You are beset with enemies both within and without
<name="cersei"> What are you doing here?
<name="maester pycelle"> I am advising the king on our current predicament
<name="cersei"> Leave
<name="maester pycell"> I am a member of the Small Council The king’s small -
<name="cersei"> Is this a Small Council meeting?
<name="maester pycell"> Obviously not I’m here to lend my wisdom and my support
<name="tommen"> Thank you for your counsel, Grand Maester That will be all for now
<name="maester pycell"> Your Grace
<name="cersei"> Since I’ve missed the past several Small Coucil meetings, I wanted to speak to you about a few things
<name="tommen"> I’ve been thinking about the High Sparrow
<name="cersei"> As have we all, unfortunately
<name="tommen"> We need to be careful in dealing with such a man To prevent things from escalating any further We have to be careful not to antagonize him He has Margaery We can’t put her at risk He’s dangerous
<name="cersei"> Look at me What did they do to me? To the king’s own mother?
<name="cersei"> It’s all right Its done It’s in the past And of course Margaery’s safety is paramount
<name="tommen"> You don’t like Margaery, do you?
<name="cersei"> Whether I like her or not is completely unimportant Margaery is the queen Queens must command respect Kings even more so Not just for their own sake, but for everyone’s The High Sparrow has no respect for kings or queens No respect for anything in this world He has no use for the things of this world He want to knock them down and replace them with what? With fantasies With beggars in the street With nothing
<name="tommen"> Mother there’s something I want to tell you Something the High Sparrow told me
<name="cersei"> You’ve spoken with him?
<name="tommen"> I promised him I wouldn’t tell anyone If he found out I told -
<name="cersei"> It would be a breach of confidence which he would not take lightly, given his constant prattling about the truth I am your mother You can always trust me
<name="cersei"> The Small Council meeting has been postponed on the king’s orders
<name="lady olenna"> I would have thought we were perfectly clear the first time You’re not welcome
<name="cersei"> You once spoke of your respect for our father because he understood the necessity of working with one’s rivals
<name="lady olenna"> My dear, you have been stripped of your dignity and authority, publicly shamed, and confined to the Red Keep What’s left to work with?
<name="jaime"> Cersei is the mother of the king She has the king’s ear and his trust And the king has been speaking regularly with the High Sparrow about Queen Margaery and Ser Loras
<name="cersei"> The High Sparrow seized power knowing full well wed bicker amongst ourselves instead of seizing it back Here we are Well done to us Now the future of the Seven Kingdoms rest in his dirty, peasant hands In a few days, he’ll have a trial for me But before that, Queen Margaery will make her walk of atonement Yes, Margaery will repent her sins before the good people of the city
<name="lady olenna"> Oh, no That cannot happen That will not happen
<name="cersei"> I agree
<name="jaime"> You’ve got the second largest army in Westeros Youll bring them into the city, stop queen Margaery’s humiliation before it starts, and take her back into Crown custody
<name="kevan"> The king has ordered me to take no action against the High Sparrow or the Faith Militant out of fear for the queen’s safety
<name="jaime"> You’ll take no action at all When the Tyrell armies come, you will stand down Are you expressly forbidden from standing down?
<name="kevan"> No, but if the king should call on me -
<name="jaime"> The whole thing will be over before anyone can call on you to do anything When the High Sparrow is in custody or dead, preferably, and Margaerys back at Tommen’s side, do you think the king will be angry at the outcome?
<name="cersei"> You hate these fanatics as much as we do You hate what they’ve done to your son Do you want Lancel back or have you given him up for good?
<name="kevan"> Of course I want him back
<name="cersei"> Then stand aside and let the people that took him from you be destroyed
<name="kevan"> If it doesn’t go as planned, the Sparrows have many friends in the city We’ll have civil war Many will die
<name="lady olenna"> Many will die no matter what we do Better them than us
<name="yara"> They told me you were home and I didn’t believe it Theon Greyjoy?” I said He’s dead He’s been dead a long time He let you go?
<name="theon"> I escaped
<name="yara"> I can’t hear you
<name="theon"> I escaped
<name="yara"> Look at me Look at me! Men died trying to rescue you Good men My men
<name="theon"> I’m sorry
<name="yara"> You were my brother You’re a spoiled little cunt, but you were my brother and I risked everything for you and you betrayed me
<name="theon"> I know I know and I’m sorry
<name="yara"> Stop saying that
<name="theon"> He broke me He broke me into a thousand pieces
<name="yara"> I know
<name="theon"> You don’t know
<name="yara"> He send us one of those pieces That’s why I came for you
<name="yara"> Why did you come here?
<name="theon"> Where else could I go?
<name="yara"> You heard father was dead and thought you’d claim the crown?
<name="theon"> No, no I only heard he died after we docked
<name="yara"> You happen to show up on Pyke right before the Kingsmoot?
<name="theon"> I didn’t know
<name="yara"> You think any Ironborn wants you to be king? After what you’ve done?
<name="theon"> I don’t want to be king
<name="yara"> What do you want?
<name="theon"> I should’ve listened to you You’re the only one -
<name="yara"> That doesn’t matter anymore Stop crying Look at me Tell me what you want
<name="theon"> You should rule the Iron Islands Let me help you
<name="ramsay"> Theyve cleaned you up nicely You know who I am?
<name="osha"> A lord?
<name="ramsay"> Yes A lord You’ve seen my banners?
<name="osha"> The flayed man
<name="ramsay"> Does that worry you at all?
<name="osha"> You eat them after?
<name="ramsay"> No
<name="osha"> Then I’ve seen worse
<name="ramsay"> You served the Starks?
<name="osha"> Aye They put me in chains and put a sword at my throat, so I’ve served them
<name="ramsay"> The Starks have been gone for a long time, but you kept protecting Rickon
<name="osha"> Hed fetch a good price to the right buyer I served his family a long time Didn’t get no wages Way I see it, I’m owed
<name="ramsay"> Be that as it may, Rickons not yours to sell anymore He’s mine So what use could I possibly have for you?
<name="osha"> I can give you what you want
<name="ramsay"> Are you sure you know what that is?
<name="osha"> Same thing men always want And when they really want it, they give it a bath first
<name="ramsay"> You’re a good talker
<name="ramsay"> I like that
<name="ramsay"> You’re a much better talker than Theon Greyjoy
<name="osha"> That so?
<name="ramsay"> I had to work hard to get him talking But he talked They all do
<name="ramsay"> He told me everything All about the Stark boys Who helped them escape, and how she did it
<name="man"> Open the gate
<name="dolorous edd"> Sorry about the food It’s not what we’re known for
<name="sansa"> That’s all right There are more important things
<name="man"> A letter for you, Lord Commander
<name="jon"> I’m not Lord Commander anymore
<name="jon"> To the traitor and bastard Jon Snow You allowed thousands of wildlings past the Wall You have betrayed your own kind You have betrayed the North Winterfell is mine, bastard Come and see Your brother Rickon is in my dungeon
<name="jon"> His direwolfs skin is on my floor Come and see I want my bride back Send her to me, bastard, and I will not trouble you or your wildling lovers Keep her from me and I will ride north and slaughter every wildling man, woman, and babe living under your protection You will watch as I skin them living You -
<name="sansa"> Go on
<name="jon"> Its just more of the same
<name="sansa"> You will watch as my soldiers take turns raping your sister You will watch as my dogs your wild little brother Then I will spoon your eyes from their sockets and let my dogs do the rest Come and see Ramsay Bolton, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North
<name="jon"> Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North
<name="sansa"> His fathers dead Ramsay killed him And now he has Rickon
<name="jon"> We don’t know that
<name="sansa"> Yes, we do
<name="tormund"> How many men does he have in his army?
<name="sansa"> I heard him say 5,000 once when he was talking about Stannis’s attack
<name="jon"> How many do you have?
<name="tormund"> That can march and fight? 2,000 The rest are children and old people
<name="sansa"> Youre the son of the last true Warden of the North Northern families are loyal They’ll fight for you if you ask
<name="sansa"> A monster has taken our home and our brother We have to go back to Winterfell and save them both

<name="khal"> Who cares about her? She’s a midget
<name="khal"> I like her
<name="khal"> She’s paler than milk
<name="khal"> I’d like to know what a khaleesi tastes like
<name="khal"> Good You can suck my dick
<name="khal moro"> She belongs with the Dosh Khaleen
<name="khal"> The Wise Masters of Yunkai want her They’re offering ten thousand horses In exchange Whats worth more, one pink little girl or ten thousand horses?
<name="khal moro"> Fuck the Wise Masters in their perfumed asses I’ll take their horses for myself
<name="daenerys"> Don’t you want to know what I think?
<name="khal moro"> You’d rather be sold to slavery? Or maybe you’d like to show Rhalko here what you taste like?
<name="daenerys"> No I don’t want either of those things
<name="khal moro"> We don’t care what you want This is the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen You have no voice here, unless you are Dosh Khaleen Which you are not, until we decide you are
<name="daenerys"> I know where I am I have been here before This is where the Dosh Khaleen pronounced my child the Stallion Who Mounts the World
<name="khal moro"> And what happened? You trusted a sorceress, like a fool Your baby is dead because of you And so is Khal Drogo
<name="daenerys"> This is where Drogo promised to take his khalasar west to where the world ends To ride wooden horses across the Black Salt Sea as no khal has done before He promised to kill the men in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses He swore to me before the Mother of Mountains
<name="khal moro"> And you were dumb enough to believe him?
<name="daenerys"> And here, now, what great matters do the Great Khals discuss? Which little villages you’ll raid, how many girls you’ll get to fuck, how many horses you’ll demand in tribute You are small men None of you are fit to lead the Dothraki But I am So I will
<name="khal moro"> All right No Dosh Khaleen for you Instead we’ll take turns fucking you And then we’ll let our bloodriders fuck you
<name="khal moro"> And If there’s anything left of you, we’ll give our horses a turn You crazy cunt Did you really think we would serve you?

<name="cersei"> Get out of my way KING
<name="soldier"> King’s orders, Your Grace

<name="jaime"> Almost
<name="tommen"> Have we caught Prince Trystane’s killers? I expect it was Mother
<name="jaime"> Your mother wouldn’t do that
<name="tommen"> Yes, she would
<name="jaime"> Are you angry with her?
<name="tommen"> Of course not
<name="jaime"> Then why didn’t you let her come? She has every right to be here
<name="tommen"> They told me she wouldn’t be allowed in the sept If she had tried -
<name="jaime"> They’re not putting your mother in a cell ever again Not while I’m here Why haven’t you gone to see her? Everything she endured, she did it for you
<name="tommen"> Don’t you think I know that? I’m sorry But I can’t
<name="jaime"> Why not?
<name="tommen"> When the Faith Militant seized her and Margaery, what did I do? When they paraded her through the streets like a whore, what did I do?
<name="jaime"> We all fail sometimes
<name="tommen"> The king is supposed to be the Protector of the Realm If I can’t even protect my own wife or my own mother, what good am I?
<name="jaime"> Go and see your mother and ask her to forgive you
<name="high sparrow"> Your Grace Lord Commander
<name="tommen"> I want to see my wife
<name="high sparrow"> The gods wait for Queen Margaery to confess her crimes and seek their mercy The king must wait as well
<name="jaime"> Go and see your mother, Tommen
<name="jaime"> You’re a bold man
<name="high sparrow"> On the contrary I fear a great deal The Father, the Mother, the Warrior
<name="high sparrow"> Do you know why we use these stones? To remind us not to fear death We close our eyes on this world and open them on the next
<name="jaime"> You must long for the next life
<name="high sparrow"> In truth, I fear that, too
<name="jaime"> You imprisoned and humiliated my sister
<name="high sparrow"> Your sister sought the gods’ mercy and atoned for her sin
<name="jaime"> What about my sins?
<name="jaime"> I broke a sacred oath and stabbed my king in the back I killed my own cousin When the gods judged my brother guilty, I helped him escape their justice What atonement do I deserve?
<name="high sparrow"> You would spill blood in this holy place?
<name="jaime"> Oh, the gods won’t mind They’ve spilled more blood than the rest of us combined
<name="high sparrow"> Go on, then I deserve it We all do We are weak, vain creatures We live only by the Mother’s mercy
<name="jaime"> They should be closer if you mean for them to save you
<name="high sparrow"> I don’t They’d never reach me before you struck
<name="jaime"> I’ve fought against worse odds
<name="high sparrow"> No doubt many of us would fall But who are we, hmm? We have no names, no family Every one of us is poor and powerless And yet together, we can overthrow an empire
<name="tommen"> Mother
<name="cersei"> Did they put her in the red gown or the gold?
<name="tommen"> Gold
<name="cersei"> Good It was always her color
<name="tommen"> I’m sorry for keeping you here I shouldn’t have, but I was I didn’t want to lose you again
<name="cersei"> I understand I’m glad to see you
<name="tommen"> I know I should have come sooner I wanted to I was wrong
<name="cersei"> It’s all right
<name="tommen"> No, it isn’t
<name="tommen"> I should have executed all of them I should have pulled down the sept onto the High Sparrow’s head before I let them do that to you, as you would have for me You raised me to be strong and I wasn’t But I want to be Help me
<name="cersei"> Always
<name="tyrion"> If I lost my cock, I’d drink all the time

<name="tyrion"> You think them
<name="varys"> So, the fleet It’s been burned
<name="grey worm"> We are searching for the men who burned the ships, but nobody saw anything
<name="tyrion"> Surely there’s some good news lurking somewhere
<name="varys"> Astapor and Yunkai have stopped asking us for aid
<name="tyrion"> Perhaps they can tell us their secret
<name="varys"> The Masters have retaken both cities Outside of Meereen, the whole of Slaver’s Bay has returned to the slavers
<name="tyrion"> What about the dragons? We have two of them here beneath the pyramid
<name="missandei"> They are not eating They haven’t touched any food since Queen Daenerys left
<name="tyrion"> Daenerys is the dragon queen Can’t very well let the dragons starve, that’s obvious
<name="grey worm"> If a dragon does not want to eat, how do you force him to eat?
<name="tyrion"> Dragons do not do well in captivity
<name="missandei"> How do you know this?
<name="tyrion"> That’s what I do I drink and I know things
<name="tyrion"> The dragons Aegon used to conquer Westeros ranged over hundreds of miles Then Daenerys’s ancestors started chaining them up in pens A few generations later, the last dragons were no larger than cats They must be unchained or they’ll waste away Missandei, how many times were you in the company of these dragons?
<name="missandei"> Many times
<name="tyrion"> And did they ever harm you?
<name="missandei"> Never
<name="tyrion"> Dragons are intelligent More intelligent than men according to some maesters They have affection for their friends and fury for their enemies I am their friend
<name="varys"> Do they know that?
<name="tyrion"> They will It’s time they had their supper
<name="tyrion"> I’m friends with your mother I’m here to help Don’t eat the help
<name="tyrion"> When I was a child an uncle asked what gift I wanted for my name day I begged him for one of you It wouldn’t even have to be a big dragon,” I told him It could be little, like me
<name="tyrion"> Everyone laughed like it was the funniest thing they had ever heard Then my father told me the last dragon had died a century ago I cried myself to sleep that night
<name="tyrion"> But here you are
<name="tyrion"> Next time I have an idea like that, punch me in the face
<name="waif"> What’s your name?
<name="waif"> What’s your name?
<name="arya"> No one
<name="waif"> I don’t believe that
<name="waif"> You don’t believe that
<name="jaqen"> Who are you?
<name="arya"> No one
<name="jaqen"> If a girl says her name, a man will let her sleep under a roof tonight
<name="arya"> A girl has no name
<name="jaqen"> If a girl says her name, a man will feed her tonight
<name="arya"> A girl has no name
<name="jaqen"> If a girl says her name, a man will give her eyes back
<name="arya"> A girl has no name
<name="jaqen"> Come
<name="jaqen"> Leave it A girl is not a beggar anymore
<name="lord kar"> He came upon the bodies on our way here
<name="roose"> Half a dozen men? Your best hunters?
<name="ramsay"> They obviously had help
<name="roose"> I didn’t think lady Sansa killed them all by herself Thank you for this report, Lord Kastark
<name="ramsay"> We know where she’s going Her brother’s at Castle Black
<name="lord kar"> Ned Stark’s last surviving son?
<name="roose"> Jon Snow is a bastard, not a Stark
<name="ramsay"> So was I, Father
<name="lord kar"> Your hold on the North will never be secure as long as a Stark can walk through that door
<name="ramsay"> Castle Black isn’t defended on the southern side And the few men left are barely men at all Farm boys and thieves With a small force we could storm the castle, kill Jon Snow -
<name="roose"> Murder the Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch? You’d unite every house in the North against us
<name="ramsay"> We don’t need every house in the North The Umbers, the Manderlys, and the Karstarks command more soldiers than all the other houses combined With their support, none could challenge us
<name="lord kar"> The Starks lost my house the day King Rob cut off my father’s head It’s time for new blood in the North
<name="roose"> If you acquire a reputation as a mad dog, you’ll be treated as a mad dog Taken out back and slaughtered for pig feed
<name="maester wolkan"> My lords Lady Walda has given birth A boy Red-cheeked and healthy
<name="lord kar"> My congratulations, Lord Bolton
<name="ramsey"> Congratulations, Father I look forward to meeting my new brother

<name="ramsay"> I am Lord Bolton
<name="lady walda"> Ramsay Ramsay, please I’ll leave Winterfell I’ll go back to the Riverlands Please Ramsay He’s your brother
<name="ramsey"> I prefer being an only child
<name="brienne"> I saw her with a man I don’t think he hurt her She didn’t want to leave him, he didn’t want to leave her
<name="sansa"> You don’t know which way she went?
<name="brienne"> I spent three days looking for her She disappeared
<name="sansa"> How did she look?
<name="brienne"> She looked good She wasn’t exactly dressed like a lady
<name="sansa"> No, she wouldn’t be
<name="brienne"> What happened at Winterfell?
<name="sansa"> I should’ve gone with you while I had the chance
<name="brienne"> It was a difficult choice, my lady
<name="brienne"> We’ve all had to make difficult choices
<name="theon"> We shouldn’t be lighting fires It’s not safe He won’t stop hunting us
<name="sansa"> We just have to make it to Castle Black Once we’re with Jon, Ramsay won’t be able to touch us
<name="theon"> Jon will have me killed the moment I step through the gate
<name="sansa"> I won’t let him I’ll tell him the truth about Bran and Rickon
<name="theon"> And the truth about the farm boys I killed in their place? The truth about Ser Rodrik, who I beheaded?
<name="theon"> And the truth about Rob, who I betrayed?
<name="sansa"> When you take the black, all your crimes are forgiven
<name="theon"> I don’t want to be forgiven I can never make amends to your family for all the things that I’ve done They’ll keep you safer than I ever could
<name="sansa"> You’re not coming with us?
<name="theon"> I would have taken you all the way to the Wall I would have died to get you there
<name="theon"> May I take one of the horses?
<name="sansa"> Where will you go?
<name="theon"> Home
<name="yara"> The Glovers have retaken Deepwood Motte
<name="balon"> And the Ironborn who held it?
<name="yara"> They died fighting to a man
<name="balon"> What is dead may never die
<name="yara"> What is dead may never die
<name="yara"> But they did and our invasion died with them Deepwood Motte was our last stronghold on the mainland
<name="balon"> They we will take more
<name="yara"> Why? For more pinecones and rocks?
<name="balon"> Because I order it
<name="yara"> We can defeat anyone at sea, but we’ll never hold lands and castles against mainland armies
<name="balon"> Not if our captains defy my orders, abandon their posts, and sacrifice our men on foolish mission
<name="yara"> I won’t apologize for trying to rescue Theon
<name="balon"> Then where is he?
<name="yara"> Where is your kingdom? We took those castles because the northerners marched off to war That war is over The last time we provoked them too far, I watched from that window as they breached our walls and knocked down our towers I lost two brothers that day
<name="balon"> And I lost three sons The War of the Five Kings, they call it Well, the other four are dead When you rule the Iron Islands, you can wage all the peace you wan But for now, shut your mouth and obey or I will make another heir who will
<name="balon"> Let me pass You fool, move aside for your king
<name="hooded figure"> Haven’t I always, brother?
<name="balon"> I thought you’d be rotting under some foreign sea by now
<name="euron"> What is dead may never die
<name="euron"> Has the custom changed since I’ve been gone? Aren’t you supposed to repeat the words?
<name="balon"> You can mock our god without my help
<name="euron"> I don’t mock the Drowned God I am the Drowned God From Oldtown to Qarth, when men see my sails, they pray
<name="euron"> You’re old, brother Youve had your time Now let another rule
<name="balon"> I heard you lost your mind during the storm on the Jade Sea They tied you to the mast to keep you from jumping overboard
<name="euron"> They did
<name="balon"> And when the storm passed, you cut out their tongues
<name="euron"> I needed silence
<name="balon"> What kind of an Ironborn loses his senses during a storm?
<name="euron"> I am the storm, brother The first storm and the last And you’re in my way
<name="aeron"> Lord, take your servant Balon back beneath the waves Feed the creatures of your kingdom on his flesh Pull his bones down to your depths to rest beside his ancestors and his children
<name="all"> What is dead may never die
<name="yara"> I’m going to find out who did this I’m going to feed them to the sharks while they live I swear it by the Salt Throne
<name="aeron"> The Salt Throne is not yours to swear upon, not unless the kingsmoot chooses you
<name="yara"> My father would’ve wanted me to rule
<name="aeron"> Your father does not get to choose The law is clear Perhaps youll win Perhaps you’ll be the first woman in history to rule the Ironborn And perhaps not
<name="melisandre"> Come in
<name="davos"> Im sorry, my lady I didn’t mean to interrupt
<name="melisandre"> You interrupt nothing
<name="davos"> I assume you know why I’m here
<name="melisandre"> I will after you tell me
<name="davos"> It’s about the Lord Commander
<name="melisandre"> The former Lord Commander
<name="davos"> Does he have to be?
<name="melisandre"> What are you asking?
<name="davos"> Do you know of any magic that could help him? Bring him back?
<name="melisandre"> If you want to help him, leave him be
<name="davos"> Can it be done?
<name="melisandre"> There are some with his power
<name="davos"> How?
<name="melisandre"> I don’t know
<name="davos"> Have you seen it done?
<name="melisandre"> I met a man who came back from the dead, but the priest who did it It shouldn’t have been possible
<name="davos"> But it was It could be now
<name="melisandre"> Not for me
<name="davos"> Not for you? I saw you drink poison that should’ve killed you I saw you give birth to a demon made of shadows
<name="melisandre"> Everything I believed, the great victory I saw in the flames, all of it was a lie
<name="melisandre"> You were right all along The Lord never spoke to me
<name="davos"> Fuck him, then Fuck all of them I’m not a devout man, obviously Seven Gods, drowned gods, tree gods, its all the same
<name="davos"> I’m not asking the Lord of Light for help.I’m asking the woman who showed me that miracles exist
<name="melisandre"> I never had this gift
<name="davos"> Have you ever tried?

<name="varys"> Would you?
<name="tyrion"> Look around The city has come back to life
<name="varys"> You made a pact with fanatics
<name="tyrion"> I did and it worked
<name="varys"> If you shaved your beard with a straight razor, you’d say the razor worked That doesn’t mean it won’t cut your throat

<name="tyrion"> The most famous dwarf in the world
<name="qyburn"> Your Grace, several members of the Faith Militant have been permitted entry to the Red Keep
<name="cersei"> Have been permitted? That’s rather a tortured way of putting it
<name="qyburn"> They demand to see you, Your Grace
<name="cersei"> Who permitted them inside the Red Keep?
<name="cersei"> The king is aware of their presence?
<name="qyburn"> He is, Your Grace He’s currently in his chambers at prayer
<name="lancel"> Your Grace, His Holiness the High Septon wishes to speak with you at the Great Sept of Baelor
<name="cersei"> His Holiness the High Septon is welcome to see me here in the Red Keep
<name="lancel"> Your Grace, this is not a request
<name="cersei"> It is a request, Cousin Lancel You are asking me for something, I’m refusing
<name="lancel"> The High Septon commands you Are you sure you want to refuse him?
<name="cersei"> He promised me I could stay in the Red Keep until my trial
<name="lancel"> He made no such promises If you refuse to come of your own free will-
<name="cersei"> Get out
<name="lancel"> Move aside, ser
<name="lancel"> Order your man to step aside or there will be violence
<name="cersei"> I choose violence
<name="cersei"> Please tell His High Holiness he’s always welcome to visit
<name="podrick"> Looks like a siege, my lady
<name="brienne"> You have a keen military mind, Pod
<name="podrick"> My lady My lady
<name="man"> Who goes there? State your business
<name="brienne"> My name is Brienne of Tarth Please inform Ser Jaime Lannister I’ve come to speak with him Tell him I have his sword
<name="bronn"> Getting a bit old to be a squire, aren’t we?
<name="bronn"> Podrick fucking Payne I thought you’d be dead by now
<name="podrick"> Not yet
<name="bronn"> Are they in there?
<name="podrick"> Mm-hmm
<name="bronn"> You think they’re fucking?
<name="podrick"> What? No
<name="bronn"> Why not? I’d fuck her You’d fuck her, wouldn’t you?
<name="podrick"> I’m her squire
<name="bronn"> Oh Well, he’d fuck her, that’s for sure And she’s fuck him, don’t you think? The way she looks at him The way all women look at him is frankly irritating I preferred working with the little brother on that account Come on, you’re the one with the magic cock
<name="bronn"> You must have shown it to her by now
<name="podrick"> She’s training me to fight
<name="bronn"> Is she? Oh
<name="podrick"> An hour in the morning, and hour at night Every day
<name="bronn"> Then how come an old cunt like me can still sneak up and murder you?
<name="podrick"> Well, that’s a different sort of fighting
<name="bronn"> Now, that’s the truth, isn’t it? You want to learn that sort of fighting?
<name="bronn"> All right, let’s start with your footwork
<name="bronn"> Show me your stance
<name="bronn"> Now, listen to me, Pod See how your feet are about a yard apart?
<name="bronn"> Lesson number one, assume everyone wants to hit you Cause they do, Pod Everyone wants to hit a fucking squire Do it again Come on, don’t sulk
<name="jaime"> I never thought you’d find her I just assumed Sansa was dead
<name="brienne"> Why would you assume that?
<name="jaime"> In my experience, girls like her don’t live very long
<name="brienne"> I don’t think you know many girls like her
<name="jaime"> Well, I’m proud of you I am You fulfilled your oath to Catelyn Stark against all odds
<name="jaime"> Of course my sister wants Sansa dead The girl is still a suspect in Joffrey’s murder, so there is that complication What the hell are you doing here?
<name="brienne"> I’ve come for the Blackfish
<name="jaime"> You’re welcome to have him
<name="brienne"> Lady Sansa desires to take her ancestral seat back from the Boltons and assume her rightful position as Lady of Winterfell
<name="jaime"> With what army does she plan on taking Winterfell?
<name="brienne"> The Tully army
<name="jaime"> They’re a bit occupied at the moment I was sent here to reclaim Riverrun currently defended by the Tully rebels, so you can see the conundrum
<name="brienne"> The Tullys are rebels because they’re fighting for their home?
<name="jaime"> Riverrun was granted to the Freys by royal decree
<name="brienne"> As a reward for betraying Robb Stark and slaughtering his family
<name="jaime"> Exactly
<name="jaime"> We shouldn’t argue about politics
<name="brienne"> You’re a knight, Ser Jaime I know there is honor in you I’ve seen it myself
<name="jaime"> I’m a Lannister Don’t ask me to betray my own house
<name="brienne"> I do no such thing Take Riverrun without bloodshed Ride south with your mission complete and your army intact
<name="jaime"> What do you propose?
<name="brienne"> Allow me to enter Riverrun under a flag of truce Let me try to persuade the Blackfish to give up the castle
<name="jaime"> Why would he abandon his ancestral home?
<name="brienne"> Because you’ll allow him to lead the Tully forces safely north
<name="jaime"> Have you ever met the Blackfish?
<name="brienne"> No
<name="jaime"> He’s even more stubborn than you are
<name="jaime"> All right Try to talk some sense into the old goat He won’t listen, but his men might Not everybody wants to die for someone else’s home
<name="brienne"> I need your word If I persuade him to abandon the castle, you’ll grant us safe passage north
<name="jaime"> You have my word You have until nightfall
<name="brienne"> You gave it to me for a purpose I’ve achieved that purpose
<name="jaime"> It’s yours It will always be yours
<name="brienne"> one last thing, Ser Jaime
<name="jaime"> Yes, Lady Brienne?
<name="brienne"> Should I fail to persuade the Blackfish to surrender, and if you attack the castle, honor compels me to fight for Sansa’s kin
<name="jaime"> Of course it does
<name="brienne"> To fight you
<name="jaime"> Let’s hope it doesn’t come to that
<name="brynden"> I’ve said no three times already
<name="brienne"> I have a signed letter from your niece Sansa Stark
<name="brynden"> I haven’t seen her since she was a child I don’t know her signature I don’t know you And I will not surrender
<name="brynden"> Double the guards tonight BRYNDEL ingslayer wants to try us I can feel it
<name="brienne"> As I have said, my name is-
<name="brynden"> Yes, Brienne of Tarth I know your father A good man
<name="brienne"> He always spoke highly of you
<name="brynden"> And if he were here now, I’d tell him the same I’m telling you
<name="brynden"> If you think I’m abandoning my family’s seat on the Kingslayer’s word of honor, you’re a bloody fool
<name="brienne"> Riverrun cannot stand against the Lannisters and the Freys
<name="brynden"> We can stand longer than your one-handed friend thinks we can
<name="brienne"> He’s not my friend
<name="brynden"> No?
<name="brynden"> Who gave you permission to cross the siege line and enter the castle? Who gave you that sword with the gold lion on the pommel?
<name="brienne"> Ser Jaime kept his word to your niece Catelyn Stark He sent me to find Sansa, to help her as Catelyn wanted He gave me this sword to protect her That is what I have done and I will continue to do until the day I die
<name="brynden"> She’s exactly like her mother
<name="brynden"> I don’t have enough men to help her take Winterfell
<name="brienne"> You have more than she does
<name="brynden"> She wants her home back I understand that But this is my home And if Jaime Lannister wants it, he can bloody well take it the way everyone else does
<name="brienne"> Find the maester We need to get a raven north to Sansa
<name="podrick"> What should I write?
<name="brienne"> Tell her I failed
<name="cersei"> There’s to be a royal announcement?
<name="kevan"> There is
<name="cersei"> Why wasn’t I informed?
<name="kevan"> There is to be a royal announcement in the throne room at this very moment
<name="kevan"> Where are you going?
<name="cersei"> To stand by my son
<name="kevan"> Your place is in the gallery with the other ladies of the court
<name="tommen"> Lords and ladies, the Faith and the Crown are the two pillars that hold up this world One collapses, so does the other The Father judges us all If you break his laws you will be punished After conferring with His Holiness the High Septon, we have determined that Loras Tyrell and Cersei lannister’s trial will be held in the Great Sept of Baelor on the first day of the Festival of the Mother
<name="tommen"> Furthermore, after much prayer and reflection, the Crown has decided that from this day forward, trial by combat will be forbidden throughout the Seven Kingdoms The tradition is a brutish one, a scheme devised by corrupt rulers in order to avoid true judgment from the gods Cersei Lannister and Loras Tyrell will stand trial before seven septons as it was in the earliest days of the Faith Seven blessings to all
<name="crowd"> Seven blessings
<name="qyburn"> Your Grace that old rumor you told me about My little birds investigated
<name="cersei"> And? Was it just a rumor or something more?
<name="qyburn"> More Much more
<name="missandei"> You seem happy
<name="tyrion"> I am happy You should both be as well Not so long ago, this city was ready to devour itself
<name="tyrion"> Now it’s like a man reborn
<name="missandei"> I will be happy when our queen returns
<name="tyrion"> Why don’t you drink? Why don’t either of you ever drink?
<name="grey worm"> Unsullied never drink
<name="tyrion"> Why not?
<name="grey worm"> Rules
<name="tyrion"> And who made these rules? Your former masters?
<name="tyrion"> Those miserable old shits didn’t want you to be human Have a drink with me
<name="tyrion"> And you? What’s your excuse?
<name="missandei"> I have tried wine before It made me feel funny
<name="tyrion"> That’s how you know it’s working
<name="tyrion"> Here’s to our queen Anyone not drinking is disrespecting our queen
<name="tyrion"> To Daenerys Stormborn, Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains, long may she reign GREY WORM
<name="missandei"> Long may she reign
<name="tyrion"> Do you like it?
<name="grey worm"> Tastes like it has turned
<name="tyrion"> Yes, yes Fermentation One day, after our queen has taken the Seven Kingdoms I’d like to have my own vineyard Make my own wine The Imp’s Delight Only my close friends could drink it
<name="tyrion"> Tell me a joke, Missandei of Naath
<name="missandei"> I do not know any jokes
<name="tyrion"> Grey worm?
<name="tyrion"> Right Three lords walk into a tavern a Stark, a Martell, and a Lannister They order ale.
<name="tyrion"> but when the barkeep brings them over, each of them finds a fly in his cup The Lannister, outraged, shoves the cup aside and demands another The Martell plucks the fly out and swallows it whole The Stark reaches into his cup, pulls out the fly and shouts, Spit it out, you see shit Spit it out
<name="tyrion"> It’s funnier in Westeros
<name="grey worm"> The Starks and the lannisters, i thought these were enemies
<name="tyrion"> Yes
<name="missandei"> A joke is like a story, Torgo Nudho Not a true story, necessarily
<name="tyrion"> A story that’s supposed to make you laugh, ideally Not at the moment, perhaps
<name="tyrion"> Missandei, do you like the wine?
<name="missandei"> I do
<name="tyrion"> Tell a joke
<name="missandei"> Two translators are on a sinking ship
<name="missandei"> The first says, Do you know how to swim?” The second says, No, but I can shout for help in 19 languages.” TYRION Ah
<name="grey worm"> That is the worst joke I ever heard
<name="missandei"> You don’t even know what a joke is
<name="grey worm"> I am soldier all my life You think I never hear joke?
<name="tyrion"> You lied to us
<name="grey worm"> I make joke
<name="missandei"> More jokes
<name="tyrion"> I once walked into a brothel with a honeycomb and a jackass The madam says-
<name="missandei"> The Masters have come for their property
<name="jaime"> Lord Edmure
<name="jaime"> I apologize for the way the Freys treated you A man of your birth deserved better You have my word you’ll be properly fed and clothes from now on
<name="edmure"> I have your word?
<name="edmure"> Oh, good Good, that’s that’s a fine thing My uncle will never surrender the castle, ser Whatever game you’re playing
<name="jaime"> The Blackfish is an old man A good death is all he can hope for But you, you have a child now, I’ve heard A son you sired on your wedding night You’re a potent man
<name="edmure"> A son I’ve never met born of a wife that I haven’t seen since our first night together
<name="jaime"> You should be with them both I can arrange that, you realize? Comfortable rooms for you at Casterly Rock A tutor for your boy, knights to train him to fight and to ride And when he comes of age, he’ll have a keep of his own
<name="edmure"> Do you imagine yourself a decent person? Is that it? After you’ve massacred my family Kept me in a cell for years Stolen our lands
<name="jaime"> I’ll remind you that our houses are at war I’m sorry if this conflict has inconvenienced you, but rebelling against the Crown does have consequences
<name="edmure"> Says the man who shoved his sword through his king’s back
<name="jaime"> Did I give you the impression that this was a negotiation? It’s not
<name="edmure"> You understand On some level you understand that you’re an evil man
<name="jaime"> I’ll leave the judgments to the gods
<name="edmure"> Well, that is convenient for you You’re a fine-looking fellow, aren’t you?
<name="edmure"> Your square jaw, your golden armor Tell me, I want to know I truly do How do you live with yourself? All of us have to believe that we’re decent, don’t we? You have to sleep at night How do you tell yourself that you’re decent after everything that you’ve done?
<name="jaime"> I was your sister’s prisoner once She hit me on the head with a rock if I remember correctly
<name="edmure"> Yeah She should have killed you
<name="jaime"> Perhaps, but she didn’t Catelyn Stark hated me just like you hate me But I didn’t hate her I admired her Far more than her husband or her son
<name="edmure"> Do you think I care whom you admire and whom you don’t?
<name="jaime"> No, I don’t, but I’m telling you anyway because you’re my prisoner You don’t have a choice The love she had for her children, I was a little awed by it Reminded me of my sister
<name="edmure"> Oh Oh, I see You’re a madman
<name="jaime"> I’m not here to trade insults Your sister was a strong-
<name="edmure"> Don’t talk about Cat
<name="jaime"> I’ll talk about whomever I want
<name="jaime"> She loved her children I suppose all mothers do, but Catelyn and Cersei, there’s a fierceness you don’t often see
<name="jaime"> They’d do anything to protect their babies
<name="jaime"> Start a war Burn cities to ash Free their worst enemies The things we do for love
<name="edmure"> You didn’t come here to talk about our sisters
<name="jaime"> That’s exactly why I came here I love Cersei You can laugh at that if you want You can sneer It doesn’t matter She needs me And to get back to her, I have to take Riverrun I’ll send for your baby boy
<name="jaime"> And I’ll launch him into Riverrun with a catapult Because you don’t matter to me, Lord Edmure Your son doesn’t matter to me The people in the castle don’t matter to me Only Cersei And if I have to slaughter every Tully who ever lived to get back to her, that’s what I’ll do
<name="guard captain"> Who goes there?
<name="edmure"> Edmure Tully, son of Hoster Tully, and the rightful Lord of Riverrun I demand entry
<name="brynden"> Don’t let him in
<name="guard captain"> He’s the Lord of Riverrun I have to obey his commands
<name="brynden"> He’s been their captive ever since they murdered his king at the Red Wedding Why do you think the people who murdered his king at the Red Wedding would decide to let him come home? Because it’s a trap, you idiot Don’t let him in
<name="guard captain"> He’s my lord, my lord I’ve sworn to serve the Lord of Riverrun and obey his commands
<name="brynden"> You’re not obeying Edmure’s commands You’re obeying the fucking Kinglsayer’s commands
<name="edmure"> I demand entry
<name="guard captain"> My lord has given an order
<name="brynden"> WIth a knife to his throat That is not a valid order
<name="guard captain"> Lower the drawbridge and open the gate for Lord Ed-
<name="brynden"> I’ll have your head before I surrender Riverrun
<name="guard captain"> You are not lord of this castle, my lord
<name="guard captain"> Lower the drawbridge
<name="guard"> Aye, ser
<name="black walder"> If you’re wrong, we’re just surrendered our most valuable prisoner
<name="guard captain"> Welcome home, my lord
<name="edmure"> Command all the forces within the castle to lay down their arms Open the gates
<name="guard captain"> My lord-
<name="edmure"> Your lord has given a command
<name="edmure"> Find the Blackfish Put him in irons and hand him over to the Freys
<name="guard captain"> Find him
<name="brynden"> Go on
<name="brienne"> Come with us
<name="brynden"> I’ve run before from the Red Wedding I’m not running again This is my family home
<name="brienne"> Your family is in the North Come with us Don’t die for pride when you can fight for your blood
<name="brynden"> You’ll serve Sansa far better than I ever could
<name="brynden"> Go on, now
<name="brynden"> I haven’t had a proper sword fight in years I expect I’ll make a damn fool of myself
<name="guard"> We found the Blackfish, my lord
<name="jaime"> Good Bring him to me
<name="guard"> He died fighting, my lord
<name="tyrion"> I was wrong I admit it
<name="missandei"> That changes nothing
<name="tyrion"> The Unsullied could mount a defense off the beachhead If the slavers’ forces-
<name="grey worm"> No more talking from you Your talking gave us this
<name="tyrion"> And I have acknowledged that I’m trying-
<name="grey worm"> You’re trying to tell me what the army should do You do not know what the army should do
<name="tyrion"> All right, what should the army do?
<name="grey worm"> We’ll not go to the beach If we go to the beach, the Masters will take the pyramid The pyramid is the only place in the city we can defend We stay here
<name="tyrion"> And then?
<name="grey worm"> We wait for them to come to us Then we fight them
<name="beric"> Clegane
<name="thoros"> What the fuck you doing here?
<name="sandor"> Chasing them You?
<name="thoros"> Hanging them
<name="sandor"> Any particular reason?
<name="beric"> They’re our men Or they were They attacked a nearby sept and murdered the villagers Why do you want them?
<name="sandor"> Same reason I was helping build it They killed a friend of mine
<name="thoros"> You’ve got friends?
<name="sandor"> Not anymore They’re mine
<name="beric"> It’s the Brotherhood’s good name they’ve dragged through the dirt
<name="sandor"> Fuck your name They’re mine I killed you once before, Dondarrion Happy to do it again
<name="sandor"> Drop that arrow, you bloody girl
<name="sandor"> Tougher girls than you have tried to kill me
<name="beric"> You can have one of them
<name="sandor"> Two
<name="thoros"> No, no, no
<name="thoros"> We’re not butchers We hang them
<name="sandor"> hanging? All over in an instant Where’s the punishment in that?
<name="thoros"> They die
<name="sandor"> We all bloody die
<name="sandor"> Except this one here I’ll only gut one of them
<name="beric"> No
<name="sandor"> I’ll chop off one hand
<name="beric"> We gave you two of the three out of respect for your loss That’s generous
<name="sandor"> Bunch of nancies
<name="sandor"> There was a time I would have killed all seven of you just to gut these three
<name="thoros"> You’re getting old, Clegane
<name="sandor"> He’s not
<name="lem"> Please don’t I’ll give you anything
<name="sandor"> Got anything to eat?
<name="thoros"> Enjoying yourself?
<name="sandor"> I prefer chicken
<name="beric"> You ought to join us We could use you
<name="sandor"> I tried joining Didn’t work out for me
<name="thoros"> Clegane, we’re here for a reason The Lord of Light is keeping Beric alive for a reason He gave a failed, drunk priest the power to bring him back for a reason We are part of something larger than ourselves
<name="sandor"> Lots of horrible shit in this world gets done for something larger than ourselves
<name="beric"> Cold winds are rising in the North
<name="sandor"> And you’re going to go stop them?
<name="beric"> We need good men to help us
<name="sandor"> Last time you saw me, you wanted to execute me
<name="beric"> True enough But the Lord of Light gave you the power to defeat me Why?
<name="sandor"> I beat you because I’m better than you, Beric I was better than you before you started yammering on about the Lord and I’m better than you now
<name="beric"> Aye, you’re probably right You’re a fighter You were born a fighter You walked away from the fight How did that go? Good and bad, young and old, the things we’re fighting will destroy them all alike You can still help a lot more than you’ve harmed Clegane, it’s not too late for you
<name="arya"> Lady Crane?
<name="arya"> Lady Crane?
<name="waif"> If you’d have done your job, she would have died painlessly
<name="waif"> Instead
<name="waif"> The Many-Faced God was promised a name He must always receive what is his You can’t change that I can’t change that No one can And now he’s been promised another name
<name="waif"> It will all be over soon On your knees or on your feet?
<name="waif"> Haven’t we been through this already? That won’t help you
<name="arya"> You told her to kill me
<name="jaqen"> Yes But here you are And there she is
<name="jaqen"> Finally a girl is no one

<name="sam"> Yeah, they do
<name="gilly"> It was before I learned how to read, obviously

<name="gilly"> If you think it’s for the best, we trust you
<name="sam"> I’d feel better if you threw something at me and stormed off
<name="gilly"> I’d never do that to the father of my son
<name="bran"> That’s my father THREE
<name="eyed raven"> The man beside him is Howland Reed, Meera’s father
<name="bran"> Ser Arthur Dayne THREE
<name="eyed raven"> The Sword of the Morning

<name="bran"> Learn what? THREE
<name="eyed raven"> Everything
<name="bloodrider"> Hey, Great Khaleesi Move your ass
<name="khal moro"> Welcome home, Khaleesi
<name="dothraki woman"> Go
<name="daenerys"> What are you doing?! Take your hands off me! I will have your heads
<name="daenerys"> You have made a mistake One you will regret I am the wife of the Great Khal
<name="dothraki matron"> We know who you are I remember you eating the stallion’s heart Why didn’t you come to us after Khal Drogo died?
<name="daenerys"> Because I am Daenerys Stormborn, the Breaker of Chains, the Queen of Meereen and the Mother of Dragons My place is not here with you
<name="dothraki matron"> You were the wife of the Great Khal You thought he would conquer the world with you at his side He didn’t I was the wife of the Great Khal Khal Savo I thought he would conquer the world with me at his side You’re young We were all young once But we all understand the way things are You will learn as well, if you are fortunate enough to stay with us
<name="daenerys"> Where else would I go? Every khaleesi becomes Dosh Khaleen
<name="dothraki matron"> Yes Immediately after the death of their khal But you went out into the world That is forbidden All the khalasars have returned for the Khalar Vezhven They will decide which cities will be sacked and which tribes will be enslaved And now they must decide what to do with Khal Drogo’s silver-haired widow With luck, your place will be here with us, Mother of Dragons It is the best you can hope for, now
<name="varys"> I don’t know how you stand it in all that leather
<name="varys"> If we could have the room
<name="varys"> You look lovely today, my dear You really do How you climbed all those steps without breaking a sweat
<name="woman"> If you’re going to torture me, just call them back and get on with it
<name="varys"> I am not a torturer
<name="varys"> Though it so often is what people deserve
<name="varys"> And it does provide answers But they’re usually the wrong answers My job is to find the right answers Do you know how I do that? I do it by making people happy I’d like to make you happy, Vala That’s your name, isn’t it, Vala?
<name="varys"> That’s all right I know who you are and what you’ve done You’ve done a lot You’ve sacrificed your body for a cause, which is more than most people do And you’ve helped the Sons of the Harpy murder the Unsullied and the Second Sons
<name="vala"> The Unsullied and the Second Songs are foreign soldiers brought here by a foreign queen to destroy our city and our history
<name="varys"> I understand Well, that makes perfect sense from your perspective I have a different perspective, of course I think it’s important that you try to see things from my perspective just as I will try to see them from yours Because that is the only way that I can make you and Dom happy That is how you pronounce it Dom? I’m afraid I don’t really speak the language Such a handsome boy Those big, brown eyes Good luck keeping the ladies away
<name="vala"> Yes, you’re a true liberator, aren’t you? You won’t torture me, you’ll just threaten my son
<name="varys"> Children are blameless I have never hurt them Your boy is in no immediate danger, this I swear to you But between us, dear, you did conspire to kill the queen’s soldiers We both know the penalty for that crime How will poor Dom get on without his mother? And with his breathing problem
<name="vala"> If I tell you anything, they’ll kill me So either you kill me or they do
<name="varys"> Yes, from your perspective, this is a problem There is a third option, though A ship leaving tomorrow for Pentos I’ve already booked passage for a woman and her young son I’ll even throw in a bag of silver to help you start again
<name="varys"> Though I’m afraid we’ll have to ask one of our leather-clad friends back in to carry it Far too heavy for me The boat sails at dawn You need to decide now A new life for you and Dom or
<name="tyrion"> What should we do while we wait? To pass the time, what should we do? What should we talk about?
<name="tyrion"> You speak 19 languages You must occasionally use some of them to talk about things
<name="tyrion"> You two, you spend a great deal of time together What would you be talking about if I weren’t here?
<name="grey worm"> Patrol When I am going on patrol with the Unsullied What we see on patrol Who we captured on patrol
<name="tyrion"> That’s good That’s very good
<name="tyrion"> But that’s a report I was thinking more of a conversation A wise man once said the truth history of the world is the history of great conversation in elegant rooms
<name="missandei"> Who said this?
<name="tyrion"> Me Just now All right, no conversations Let’s play a game
<name="tyrion"> You don’t play games, either one of you, ever?
<name="grey worm"> Games are for children
<name="missandei"> My master Kraznys would sometimes make us play games
<name="tyrion"> There, that’s a start
<name="missandei"> Only the girls
<name="tyrion"> Oh no, no, no Not that, of course not that Innocent games, fun games, drinking games
<name="missandei"> We do not drink
<name="tyrion"> Until you do
<name="tyrion"> Alright No drinking We can play without drinking It’s a wonderful game I invented it Here’s how it works I make a statement about your past If I’m wrong, I drink And if I’m right Maybe we can’t play without drinking
<name="tyrion"> Oh, you took your time
<name="varys"> Sorry I was busy learning who funds the Sons of the Harpy Some things you can’t rush
<name="missandei"> You found out?
<name="varys"> The good masters of Astapor And the wise masters of Yunkai With help from their friends in Volantis
<name="tyrion"> You see? You don’t even have to worry about the local rebellion We only have to worry about the three rich foreign cities paying for it
<name="grey worm"> We conquered Asatapor and Yunkai once We will do it again and execute the Masters
<name="tyrion"> If the Unsullied march off to reconquer Asatapor and Yunkai, who remain to defend the free people of Meereen?
<name="grey worm"> If we do not fight them, how can we stop them?
<name="missandei"> We cannot The Masters only speak one language They spoke it to me for many years I know it better than my mother tongue If we want them to hear us, we must speak it back to them May it be the last thing they ever hear
<name="tyrion"> You may be right
<name="grey worm"> So we will fight them?
<name="tyrion"> Possibly
<name="missandei"> Possibly?
<name="tyrion"> It’s a conversation
<name="tyrion"> Tell me, can the little birds get a message to the good Masters of Astapor, the wise Masters of Yunkai, the benevolent enslavers of Volantis?
<name="varys"> Of course Man can be fickle, but birds always trust
<name="qyburn"> Your eye looks much better, Arthur How’s your mother’s jaw?
<name="arthur"> Better
<name="qyburn"> And your father?
<name="arthur"> No one’s seen him
<name="qyburn"> And no one will That worked out rather nicely
<name="little bird"> Will Lord Varys ever come back?
<name="qyburn"> I don’t think so Do you miss him?
<name="little bird"> He was nice
<name="arthur"> He called us his little birds He gave us sweets
<name="qyburn"> It’s funny you should mention that Guess what I happened to find today Candied plums from Dorne
<name="qyburn"> Now remember, if any of your friends like sweets or need help, they can always come to me All I need in return are whispers
<name="qyburn"> No need to be afraid This is Ser Gregor He’s friends with all my friends
<name="qyburn"> Run along now
<name="cersei"> Varyss little birds?
<name="qyburn"> Your little birds now, your Grace
<name="jaime"> What did you do to him exactly? I havent been able to get a clear answer
<name="qyburn"> Oh, a number of things
<name="jaime"> Does he understand what we’re saying? I mean, to the extent that he ever understood complete sentences in the first place
<name="qyburns"> He understands well enough
<name="jaime"> So tell him to march into the sept and crush the High Sparrow’s head like a melon
<name="cersei"> The High Sparrow has hundreds of Faith Militant surrounding him Ser Gregor will can’t face them all And he won’t have to He’ll only have to face one
<name="jaime"> Has the Faith leveled official charges yet?
<name="cersei"> Not yet
<name="jaime"> That is one trial by combat I look forward to watching
<name="cersei"> Don’t stop at the city I want little birds in Dorne, in Highgarden, in the North If someone is planning on making our losses their gains I want to hear it If someone is laughing at the queen who walk naked through the streets covered in shit, I want to hear I want to know who they are I want to where they are
<name="maester pycelle"> As bad as Lord Varys was Varys was, Qyburn is worse I told them all I told them He’s arrogant, dangerous You don’t get thrown out of the Citadel without good reason And no one listened to my advice, so here we are
<name="maester pycelle"> And what hes done to Gregor Clegane is an abomination We never sanctioned this, this experiment And I for one think it would be in our best interest to have the beast dest -
<name="kevan"> Can I help you?
<name="cersei"> Why are you here?
<name="mace"> My mother.
<name="lady olenna"> I was invited, my dear, o help deal with several troublesome issues, such as the queen’s imprisonment
<name="cersei"> Thank you for bringing it up It’s well past time we addressed the abuses I endured
<name="lady olenna"> Margaery is the queen You are not the queen because you’re not married to the king I do appreciate these things can get a bit confusing in your family
<name="kevan"> This is a Small Council meeting You have no position on the Small Council
<name="jaime"> I’m Lord Commander of the Kingsguard The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard does have a position on the Small Council
<name="cersei"> Grand Maester Pycelle, would you sanction that statement?
<name="maester pycelle"> Well, um I would say Ser Gerold Hightower had a seat on the Mad King’s council Of course, that was the Mad King King Robert saw things differently
<name="cersei"> What about Myrcella’s death, Uncle? Do you consider the murder of your own blood a troublesome issue?
<name="jaime"> The same women who murdered Myrcella have overthrown House Martell and taken control of Dorne Weve got a lot to discuss All of us together
<name="cersei"> And seeing as you cannot make us leave, we best get on with it
<name="kevan"> No, we cannot make you leave And you cannot make us stay Not unless youre gonna have that thing murder us all
<name="high sparrow"> Oh, your Grace
<name="tommen"> My mother would like to see her daughter’s final resting place
<name="high sparrow"> Oh, Im, sorry, your Grace That’s not possible Not yet
<name="tommen"> When will it be possible?
<name="high sparrow"> When shes fully atoned for her sins
<name="tommen"> You’ve cut off her hair and marched her naked through the streets in front of the whole city That wasn’t a full atonement?
<name="high sparrow"> No She must stand trial before seven septons, so we can learn the true extant of her sins
<name="tommen"> I want you to let her see Myrcella’s resting place
<name="tommen"> I am the king
<name="high sparrow"> You are
<name="tommen"> And what does that mean to you?
<name="high sparrow"> It means a great deal to me The crown and the faith are the twin pillars of the world Do you know who told me that? Your mother
<name="tommen"> My mother who is unclean? My mother who still needs to atone after all you’ve put her through?
<name="high sparrow"> How do you think the Mother Above first came to us? How did men and women first come to feel the Mother’s presence? It was through their own mothers There is a great deal of falsehood in Cersei, you know that But when she speaks of you, the Mother’s love outshines it all Her love for you is more real than anything else in this world Because it doesn’t come from this world But you know that You’ve felt it You’ve seen her when she talks to you
<name="tommen"> Yes
<name="high sparrow"> It’s a great gift One I never had Envy One more thing for me to atone for
<name="high sparrow"> You Grace, may I? Do you mind? Its my knees
<name="tommen"> Of course
<name="high sparrow"> When your mother made her walk of atonement, she did it to get back to you
<name="tommen"> I still don’t understand why you want to put her through any more than shes already endured
<name="high sparrow"> It’s not what I want It’s what the gods want They make their will known to us and it’s up to us to either accept or reject it
<name="high sparrow"> Please
<name="high sparrow"> If we’re to be just and good, then we accept it, all of us, even kings A true leader avails himself of the wisest council he can And no one is wiser than the gods
<name="tommen"> My grandfather once said something similar Except for the part about the gods
<name="high sparrow"> The gods worked through him whether he knew it or not As they work through your mother There’s so much good in all of us The best we can do is to help each other bring it out
<name="waif"> Who are you?
<name="arya"> No one
<name="waif"> Who were you before you came here?
<name="arya"> Arya Stark
<name="waif"> Tell me about Arya Stark’s family
<name="arya"> Her father was Eddard Stark Her mother was Catelyn Stark She had one sister, Sansa, and four brothers
<name="arya"> Three brothers
<name="arya"> Rob, Bran, Rickon And a half-brother, Jon
<name="waif"> And where are they now?
<name="arya"> They may be dead for all a girl knows
<name="waif"> Tell me about The Hound
<name="arya"> Also dead
<name="arya"> Arya Stark left him to die He was on her list
<name="arya"> He was not on her list anymore She’d taken him off it
<name="waif"> Why? Didn’t she want him dead any longer?
<name="arya"> She did and she did not
<name="waif"> She sounds confused
<name="arya"> Yes, she was
<name="waif"> Who else was on Arya Stark’s funny little list?
<name="arya"> Cersei Lannister, Gregor Clegane, Walder Frey
<name="waif"> That’s a short list That can’t be everyone you want to kill
<name="waif"> Are you sure you’re not forgetting someone?
<name="arya"> Which name would you like a girl to speak?
<name="jaqen"> If a girl tells me her name, I will give her eyes back
<name="arya"> A girl has no name
<name="jaqen"> Come
<name="jaqen"> If a girl is truly no one, she has nothing to fear
<name="jaqen"> Who are you?
<name="arya"> No one
<name="ramsay"> The Umbers are a famously loyal house
<name="lord kar"> Famously loyal to the Starks
<name="smalljon"> And you, Lord Karstark? Your people share blood with the Starks, don’t they? But here we are Times change
<name="ramsay"> When my father became Warden of the North, your house refused to pledge their banners
<name="smalljon"> Your father was a cunt
<name="ramsay"> My beloved father, the Warden -
<name="smalljon"> Your father was a cunt and that’s why you killed him I might’ve done the same to my father, if he hadn’t have done me the favor of dying on his own
<name="ramsay"> My father was poisoned by our enemies
<name="smalljon"> Mmm
<name="ramsay"> Why have you come to Winterfell, Lord Umber?
<name="smalljon"> The bastard Jon Snow led an army of wildlings past the Wall We’re farther north than any of you fuckers Wildlings come down, we always have to fight them first I like fighting wildlings, been doing it all my life But there are too many of them for us to beat back alone
<name="ramsay"> So now you’ve come seeking help?
<name="smalljon"> We need to help each other The colder it gets, the farther South those goat fuckers will roam Wont take them long to get here
<name="lord kar"> You think a horde of wildlings can take Winterfell?
<name="smalljon"> If they get Jon Snow leading them, maybe He knows this place better than we ever will
<name="ramsay"> Pledge your banners to House Bolton Swear loyalty to me as Warden of the North and we will fight together to destroy the bastard and all his wildling friends
<name="smalljon"> I’m not kissing your fucking hand
<name="ramsay"> Traditionally a bannerman kneels before his lord
<name="smalljon"> I’m not doing that either
<name="ramsay"> Why would I trust a man who won’t honor tradition?
<name="smalljon"> Your father honored tradition Knelt for Robb Stark Called him King of the North Was Robb Stark right to trust your father?
<name="ramsay"> Then it appears were at a bit of an impasse
<name="smalljon"> Fuck kneeling and fuck oaths Ive got a gift for you
<name="ramsay"> A girl, I hope I prefer redheads
<name="smalljon"> A girl, aye A wild one
<name="ramsay"> I like them wild
<name="smalljon"> And the boy, nice and young The way Karstark likes them
<name="ramsay"> Who’s this?
<name="smalljon"> Rickon Stark
<name="ramsay"> How do I know that’s Rickon Stark?
<name="ramsay"> Welcome home, Lord Stark
<name="dolorous edd"> It’s time
<name="jon"> If you have any last words, now is the time
<name="bowen marsh"> You shouldn’t be alive It’s not right
<name="jon"> Neither was killing me
<name="othell yarwick"> My mothers still living at White Harbor Could you write her? Tell her I died fighting the wildings
<name="alliser throne"> I had a choice, Lord Commander Betray you or betray the Night’s Watch You brought an army of wildlings into our lands An army of muderers and raiders If I had to do it all over knowing where I’d end up, I pray I’d make the right choice again
<name="jon"> I’m sure you would, Ser Alliser
<name="alliser throne"> I fought, I lost Now I rest But you, Lord Snow, you’ll be fighting their battles forever
<name="dolorous edd"> We should burn the bodies
<name="jon"> You should
<name="dolorous edd"> What do you want me to do with this?
<name="jon"> Wear it Burn it Whatever you want You have Castle Black

EPISODE "THE BROKEN MAN" - 05/06/2016


<name="man"> That’s it Get it to the top
<name="man"> Steady Steady
<name="ray"> Up she goes
<name="ray"> Hey, come on Put your back into it, huh?
<name="ray"> Here you are, son
<name="ray"> Oh, gentlemen, please And you lot, come on Come on, get it moving Come on, come on
<name="ray"> In all my days I’ve never seen a man swing an ax like that How many men did it take to cut you down?
<name="sandor"> Just one
<name="ray"> Ooh he must have been some kind of monster
<name="sandor"> He was a woman
<name="ray"> I think some of the men are a bit afraid of you
<name="sandor"> I’m used to it
<name="ray"> When I found you, I thought you’d been dead for days The way you were stinking already and you had bugs all over you and bone was coming through right there
<name="ray"> I was gonna give you a proper burial and then you coughed Oh, nearly shit myself I reckoned you were gonna die by the time I loaded you on the wagon, but you didn’t Now, I reckoned you’d die a dozen more times over the next few days, but you didn’t What kept you going?
<name="sandor"> Hate
<name="ray"> No, there’s a reason you’re still here
<name="sandor"> Aye, there’s a reason I’m a big fucker and I’m tough to kill
<name="ray"> No, a reason Gods aren’t done with you yet
<name="sandor"> I’ve heard that before Man was talking about a different god, though
<name="ray"> Well, maybe he was right I don’t know much about the gods
<name="sandor"> You’re in the wrong line of work
<name="ray"> Oh, there’s plenty of pious sons of bitches who think they know the word of god or gods I don’t I don’t even know their real names Maybe it is the Seven Or maybe it’s the old gods Or maybe it’s the Lord of Light Or maybe they’re all the same fucking thing I don’t know What matters, I believe, is that there’s something greater than us And whatever it is, it’s got plans for Sandor Clegane
<name="sandor"> You didn’t know me back in my time You don’t know the things I’ve done
<name="ray"> I’ve heard stories
<name="sandor"> If the gods are real why haven’t they punished me?
<name="ray"> They have
<name="high sparrow"> Your Grace What are we reading today?
<name="margaery"> The Book of the Mother, Your Holiness Chapter three, verse 12
<name="high sparrow"> Ah, As water rounds the stones, smoothing -
<name="margaery"> Smoothing what was jagged, so does a woman’s love calm a man’s brute nature A wife salves her husband’s wounds, a mother sings her son to sleep
<name="high sparrow"> You learn quickly There are some who know every verse of the sacred text, but don’t have a drop of the Mother’s mercy in their blood and savages who can’t read at all who understand the Father’s wisdom
<name="margaery"> For year I pretended to love the poor, the afflicted I had pity for them, but I never loved them They disgusted me
<name="high sparrow"> They are hard to love
<name="high sparrow"> The poor disgust us because they are us, shorn of our illusions They show us what we’d look like without our fine clothes How’d we smell without perfume
<name="high sparrow"> Can I ask you about a personal matter?
<name="margaery"> Of course
<name="high sparrow"> The king mentioned that since your reunion, you haven’t joined him in the marriage bed
<name="margaery"> No
<name="high sparrow"> You have a duty, Your Grace To your husband, your king, your country, to the gods themselves
<name="margaery"> It’s just the desires that once drove me no longer do
<name="high sparrow"> Congress does not require desire on the woman’s part, only patience The king must have an heir if we are to continue our good work
<name="margaery"> Forgive me Sometimes the truth path is hard to find
<name="high sparrow"> Hard to find and harder still to walk upon But you’ve made great progress I only pray your grandmother follows your lead
<name="margaery"> My grandmother?
<name="high sparrow"> Yes The Queen of Thorns is a remarkable woman, a strong woman, and an unrepentant sinner You must teach her the new way as she taught you the old Or I fear for her safety, body and soul
<name="olenna"> Does it move or talk? I want to speak with you alone
<name="margaery"> Septa Unella has been my true friend and counselor
<name="olenna"> Oh, this is madness
<name="olenna"> You’re not in your sanctuary now, my dear All I have to do is whistle and my men will stroll in here and bash you about.
<name="margaery"> Grandmother
<name="olenna"> until I tell them to stop If I tell them to stop You could use a good bashing
<name="margaery"> Grandmother, please
<name="olenna"> What have they done to you?
<name="margaery"> You marched against the High Sparrow, against the Faith
<name="olenna"> We marched for you
<name="margaery"> The gods could have punished you and Father, but they didn’t They showed mercy
<name="olenna"> And what about your brother? What mercy did they show him?
<name="margaery"> Loras’s only hope is to confess his crimes and repent If he does, the Faith will allow him to return to Highgarden He’ll have to renounce his name and title.
<name="olenna"> Have you lost your mind?
<name="margaery"> and live his life as a penitent
<name="olenna"> He is the heir to Highgarden, the future of House Tyrell
<name="margaery"> He can begin again
<name="olenna"> As a mindless fanatic
<name="margaery"> As a free man
<name="olenna"> You will leave for Highgarden today There is no law that says you must stay here
<name="margaery"> I am the queen It is my duty to serve my husband the king
<name="margaery"> But you should leave, Grandmother Your place is at home
<name="olenna"> I will never leave you Never
<name="margaery"> You must
<name="margaery"> Go home Find comfort in prayer and good works
<name="margaery"> The Mother watches over us all
<name="olenna"> I’ll see you soon, my dear
<name="margaery"> Seven blessings to you, Grandmother
<name="margaery"> Shall we pray?
<name="dim dalba"> We said we’d fight with you, King Crow, when the time comes and we meant it, but this isn’t what we agreed to These aren’t White Walkers This isn’t an army of the dead This isn’t our find
<name="tormund"> If it weren’t for him, none of us would be here All of you would be meat in the Night King’s army And I’d be a pile of charred bones just like Mance
<name="dim dalba"> Remember Mance’s camp? It stretched all the way to the horizon And look at us now Look what’s left of us And if we lose this, we’re gone Dozens of tribes, hundreds of generations Be like we were never there at all We’ll be the last of the free folk
<name="jon"> That’s what’ll happen to you if we lose The Boltons, the Karstarks, the Umbers, they know you’re here They know that more than half of you are women and children After they finish with me, they’ll come for you You’re right This isn’t your fight You shouldn’t have to come to Winterfell with me I shouldn’t be asking you It’s not the deal we made I need you with me if we’re gonna beat them, and we need to beat them if you’re going to survive
<name="tormund"> The crows killed him because he spoke for the free folk when no other southerners would He died for us If we are not willing to do the same for him, we’re cowards And if that’s what we are, we deserve to be the last of the free folk
<name="wun wun"> Snow
<name="jon"> Are you sure they’ll come?
<name="tormund"> We’re not clever like you southerners When we say we’ll do something, we do it
<name="cersei"> I heard you were leaving King’s Landing
<name="olenna"> That is hardly your concern
<name="cersei"> Your grandson is still a prisoner You’ll leave him rotting in a cell?
<name="olenna"> Loras rots in a cell because of you THe High Sparrow rules this city because of you Our two ancient houses face collapse because of you and your stupidity
<name="cersei"> You’re right I made a terrible mistake I carry it with me every single day
<name="olenna"> Good
<name="cersei"> I delivered an army of fanatics onto our doorstep And now we must fight them together We need each other
<name="olenna"> I wonder if you’re the worst person I’ve ever met At a certain age, it’s hard to recall But the truly vile do stand out through the years Do you remember the way you smirked at me when my grandson and granddaughter were dragged off to their cells? I do I’ll never forget it
<name="cersei"> You love your granddaughter I love my son It’s the only truth I know We must defend them
<name="olenna"> I’m leaving this wretched city as fast as I can before that shoeless zealot throws me into one of his cells If you’re half as bright as you think you are, you’ll find your way out of here, too
<name="cersei"> Never I’ll never leave my son
<name="olenna"> What’ll you do, then? You have no support Not anymore Your brother’s gone The High Sparrow saw to that The rest of your family have abandoned you The people despise you You’re surrounded by enemies, thousands of them You’re going to kill them all by yourself? You’ve lost, Cersei It’s the only joy I can find in all this misery
<name="man"> Pick the pace up Keep going
<name="man"> Keep it moving
<name="bronn"> Now, that is a sorry attempt at a siege Someone needs to teach those sad twats how to dig trenches
<name="jaime"> Someone certainly does
<name="bronn"> Oh, no Not me I’m just an upjumped sellsword
<name="jaime"> You’re an anointed knight There’s quite a difference
<name="bronn"> Aye, knights don’t get paid
<name="jaime"> You have better instincts than any officer in the Lannister army
<name="bronn"> That’s like saying I have a bigger cock than anyone in the Unsullied army
<name="jaime"> I expect to command all the Lannister forces before long You can be the right hand I lost
<name="bronn"> You promised me a lordship and a castle and a highborn beauty for a wife
<name="jaime"> And you’ll get all three A Lannister always-
<name="bronn"> Don’t say it Don’t fucking say it
<name="lothar"> Come out and fight us, Blackfish Yield the castle or we’ll hang him
<name="lothar"> This is your last warning Yield the castle
<name="black walder"> You think I won’t do it, old man?
<name="black walder"> I sliced your niece’s throat from ear to ear And where were you? Running and hiding like a fucking coward Yield the castle or I cut his throat
<name="brynden"> Go on, then Cut his throat
<name="jaime"> Lothar, is it?
<name="lothar"> Ser Jaime We didn’t know you were coming
<name="jaime"> Cause you didn’t set up a proper perimeter You just allowed 8,000 men to approach unchallenged
<name="bronn"> Good thing we’re friends or we’d be fucking you in the ass right now
<name="jaime"> Have Lord Edmure bathed and fed
<name="black walder"> Whoa, whoa
<name="lothar"> Walder
<name="black walder"> Edmure is a prisoner of House Frey
<name="jaime"> Only a fool makes threats he’s not prepared to carry out Now let’s say I threatened to hit you unless you shut your mouth, but you kept talking What do you think I’d do?
<name="black walder"> I don’t give a rat’s-
<name="jaime"> I’m here by the king’s command to take back this castle Have him bathed and fed Unless you’d like to take his place
<name="lothar"> Apologies, Ser Jaime
<name="lothar"> Do as he says
<name="jaime"> The siege is now under my command The next time the Blackfish looks out from those ramparts, he’ll see an army at his gates, not whatever this is
<name="bronn"> Have your lads start digging perimeter trenches Set pickets every hundred yards And work double-time on those siege towers and trebuchets
<name="black walder"> Those are our siege towers-
<name="jaime"> As I said, the siege is under my command If that’s not to your liking, go home
<name="jaime"> Get word to the Blackfish I want a parley
<name="bronn"> A parley or a fight?
<name="jaime"> He’s an old man
<name="bronn"> You’ve got one hand My money’s on the old boy
<name="jon"> Lady Mormont
<name="lyanna"> Welcome to Bear Island
<name="sansa"> I remember when you were born, my lady You were named for my Aunt Lyanna It was said she was a great beauty I’m sure you will be, too
<name="lyanna"> I doubt it My mother wasn’t a great beauty or any other kind of beauty She was a great warrior, though She died fighting for your brother, Robb
<name="jon"> I served under your uncle at Castle Black, Lady Lyanna He was also a great warrior and an honorable man I was his steward In fact-
<name="lyanna"> I think we’ve had enough small talk What are you here?
<name="jon"> Stannis Baratheon garrisoned at Castle Black before he marched on Winterfell and was killed He showed me the letter you wrote to him when he petitioned for men It said-
<name="lyanna"> I remember what it said Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North whose name is Stark
<name="jon"> Robb is gone, but House Stark is not And it needs your support now more than ever I’ve come with my sister to ask for House Mormont’s allegiance
<name="lyanna"> As far as I understand, you’re a Snow and Lady Sansa is a Bolton Or is she a Lannister? I’ve heard conflicting reports
<name="sansa"> I did what I had to do to survive, my lady But I am a Stark I will always be a Stark
<name="lyanna"> If you say so In any case, you don’t just want my allegiance You want my fighting men
<name="jon"> Ramsay Bolton cannot be allowed to keep Winterfell, my lady It is our duty to stop him Even more so because he holds our brother Rickon Stark as prisoner What you have to understand, my lady, is that-
<name="lyanna"> I understand that I’m responsible for Bear Island and all who live here So why should I sacrifice one more Mormont life for someone else’s war?
<name="davos"> If it please, my lady, I understand how you feel
<name="lyanna"> I don’t know you, Ser ?
<name="davos"> Davos, my lady, of House Seaworth
<name="davos"> You needn’t ask your maester about my house It’s rather new
<name="lyanna"> All right, Ser Davos of House Seaworth How is it you understand how I feel?
<name="davos"> You never thought you’d find yourself in your position Being responsible for so many lives at such a young age I never thought I’d be in my position I was a crabber’s son, then I was a smuggler And now I found myself addressing the lady of a great house in time of war But I’m here because this isn’t someone else’s war It’s our war
<name="lyanna"> Go on, Ser Davos
<name="davos"> Your uncle, Lord Commander Mormont, made that man his steward He chose Jon to be his successor because he knew had the courage to do what was right, even if it meant giving his life Because Jeor Mormont and Jon Snow both understood that the real war isn’t between a few squabbling houses It’s between the living and the dead And make no mistake, my lady, the dead are coming
<name="lyanna"> Is this true?
<name="jon"> Your uncle fought them at the Fist of the First Men I fought them at Hardhome We both lost
<name="davos"> As long as the Boltons hold Winterfell, the North is divided And a divided North won’t stand a chance against the Night King You want to protect your people, my lady I understand But there’s no hiding from this We have to fight and we need to do it together
<name="lyanna"> House Mormont has kept faith with House Stark for 1,000 years We will not break faith today
<name="jon"> Thank you, my lady How many fighting men can we expect?
<name="lyanna"> 62
<name="jon"> 62?
<name="lyanna"> We are not a large house, but we’re a proud one And every man from Bear Island fights with the strength of 10 mainlanders
<name="davos"> If they’re half as ferocious as their lady, the Boltons are doomed
<name="brynden"> Kingslayer
<name="jaime"> Blackfish
<name="brynden"> I assume you’re here to fulfill the vow you gave my niece I don’t see Sansa and Arya
<name="jaime"> I don’t have them
<name="brynden"> Pity Do you wish to resume your captivity?
<name="brynden"> Then why are you here?
<name="jaime"> You know why I’m here This castle belongs to House Frey You’re trespassing In the name of King Tommen, I order you to surrender or-
<name="brynden"> Or you’ll kill Edmure?
<name="brynden"> My nephew’s marked for death no matter what Hang him and be done with it
<name="jaime"> It won’t stop with Edmure You’ll force me to storm the castle Hundreds will die
<name="brynden"> Hundreds of mine Thousands of yours If you can breach the walls
<name="jaime"> We’ll breach them and kill every last one of you But if you surrender, I’ll spare the lives of your men On my honor
<name="brynden"> Your honor? Bargaining with oathbreakers is like building on quicksand
<name="jaime"> The war is over, ser Why sacrifice living men to a lost cause?
<name="brynden"> As long as I’m standing, the war is not over This is my home I was born in this castle and I’m ready to die in it So you can either attack or try to starve us out We have enough provisions for two years Do you have two years, Kingslayer?
<name="jaime"> You clearly have no intention of saving your men’s lives Why did you come to treat with me?
<name="brynden"> Sieges are dull And I wanted to see you in person, get the measure of you
<name="jaime"> Well, now you have
<name="brynden"> Aye, now I have I’m disappointed
<name="robett"> The answer is no
<name="jon"> Lord Glover, if you could just hear us out
<name="robett"> I’ve heard enough We’ve only just taken back this castle from the Ironborn The Boltons helped us do it Now you want me to fight against them? I could be skinned for even talking to you
<name="jon"> The Boltons are traitors Roose Bolton-
<name="robett"> Have other northern houses pledged to fight for you?
<name="jon"> House Mormont
<name="robett"> And?
<name="jon"> We sent raven to Houses Manderly-
<name="robett"> I don’t care about ravens You’re asking me to join your army Who is fighting in this army?
<name="jon"> The bulk of the force is made up of wildlings
<name="robett"> Then the rumors are true I didn’t dare believe them I received you out of respect for your father Now I would like you to leave House Glover will not abandon its ancestral home to fight alongside wildlings
<name="jon"> Lord Glover
<name="robett"> There’s nothing else to say
<name="sansa"> I would remind you that House Glover is pledged to House Stark Sworn to answer when called upon
<name="robett"> Yes, my family served House Stark for centuries We wept when we heard of your father’s death When my brother was lord of this castle, he answered Robb’s call and hailed him King in the North
<name="robett"> And where was King Robb when the Ironborn attacked this castle? When they threw my wife and children in prison and brutalized and killed our subjects? Taking up with a foreign whore Getting himself and those who followed him killed
<name="robett"> I served House Stark once, but House Stark is dead
<name="theon"> Why did we have to come here?
<name="yara"> Some of us still like it Have a drink at least
<name="theon"> I don’t want one
<name="yara"> Don’t go far, love
<name="yara"> I’ll find you in a bit
<name="yara"> Nothing on the Iron Islands has an ass like that Doesn’t interest you anymore?
<name="yara"> I’m sorry I won’t joke about it I’ll never hurt you, little brother Don’t you know that?
<name="theon"> You think Uncle Euron’s hunting for us?
<name="yara"> Of course he is As long as we’re alive, we’re a threat
<name="theon"> He’ll find us
<name="yara"> It’s a great big world and we have fast ships Drink
<name="theon"> I don’t want any
<name="yara"> I don’t care what you want Drink
<name="yara"> Drink it all
<name="yara"> You’re Ironborn, Theon I know you’ve had some bad years
<name="theon"> Some bad years?
<name="yara"> But I’m tired of watching you cower like a beat dog Drink the goddamn ale
<name="yara"> Now listen to me I need you The real Theon Greyjoy, not this rat shit pretender Can you find him for me? Drink
<name="yara"> You escaped, do you hear me? You got away and you’re never going back We’ll get justice for you
<name="theon"> If I got justice, my burnt body would hang over the gates of Winterfell
<name="yara"> Fuck justice, then We’ll get revenge Drink
<name="yara"> Listen to me If you’re so broken that there’s no coming back, take a knife and cut your wrists End it But if you’re staying, Theon, I need you We’re gonna sail to Meereen We’re gonna make a pact with this Dragon Queen And we’re gonna take back the Iron Islands
<name="yara"> Are you with me? Are you really with me?
<name="yara"> Now, since it’s my last night ashore for a long while, I’m gonna go fuck the tits off this one
<name="davos"> Stannis camped here on his way to Winterfell
<name="sansa"> And that’s a good thing?
<name="davos"> He was the most experienced commander in Westeros He chose this place for a reason Those mountains are a natural fortification There’s a stream down there for the horses
<name="jon"> We’re not staying here long Another storm could hit any day
<name="davos"> Aye, the snows defeated Stannis as much as the Boltons did
<name="jon"> We have to march on Winterfell now while we still can
<name="davos"> 2,000 Wildlings 200 Hornwoods, 143 Mazins-
<name="sansa"> 62 Mormonts
<name="davos"> It’s not what we’d hoped for But we still have a chance if we’re careful and smart
<name="davos"> For fuck’s sake
<name="sansa"> So he’s your most trusted advisor now? Because he secured 62 men from a ten year old?
<name="jon"> Ser Davos is the reason I’m standing here talking to you and he served Stannis for years
<name="sansa"> Stannis who lost the Blackwater, who murdered his own brother, who doesn’t have a head?
<name="sansa"> It’s not enough We need more men
<name="jon"> There’s no time
<name="sansa"> If we went down to Castle Cerwyn, I know that Lord-
<name="jon"> We fight with the army we have
<name="davos"> Friends, this is not worth fighting over
<name="davos"> This’ll be it, now Right now, we don’t need to be fighting
<name="man"> Who the fuck are you?
<name="davos"> Hold on
<name="man"> Yeah, who the fuck are you?
<name="ray"> I was a soldier once All my superiors thought I was brave I wasn’t I mean, I never ran from a fight Only because I was afraid my friends would see I was afraid That’s all I was, a coward We followed orders no matter the orders Burn that village Fine, I’m your arsonist Steal that farmer’s crops Good, I’m your thief Kill those young lads so they won’t take up arms against us I’m your murderer I remember once a woman screaming at us, calling us animals as we dragged her son from their hut But we weren’t animals Animals are true to their nature and we had betrayed ours I cut that young boy’s throat myself as his mother screamed and my friends held her back
<name="ray"> That night I felt such shame Shame was so heavy on me, I couldn’t eat, I couldn’t sleep
<name="ray"> All I could do was stare into that dark sky and listen to that mother screaming her son’s name I’ll hear her screaming the rest of my life
<name="ray"> Now, I know I can never bring that lad back All I can do with time I’ve got left is bring a little goodness into the world That’s all any of us can do, isn’t it? Never too late to stop robbing people, to stop killing people Start helping people
<name="ray"> It’s never too late to come back
<name="ray"> And it’s not about waiting for the gods to answer your prayers It’s not even about the gods It’s about you Learning you have to answer your prayers yourself
<name="ray"> Seven save you, friends How can we help you?
<name="lem"> What are you doing here?
<name="ray"> Well, we’re talking about life You?
<name="lem"> Protecting the people
<name="ray"> Well, we thank you for your protection Who are you protecting us from?
<name="lem"> Do you have any horses?
<name="ray"> No horses No gold No steel
<name="lem"> Food, then Protecting the people is hungry work
<name="ray"> I’m sure it is You’re welcome to stay for supper, but we have hungry mouths here
<name="lem"> Stay safe The night is dark and full of terrors
<name="sandor"> Seven save you, friends
<name="ray"> I’m a fucking septon What was I supposed to say?
<name="sandor"> They don’t believe in your Seven They’re from the Brotherhood They follow the Red God
<name="ray"> Aye, well, all are welcome here Anyway, we got nothing for them
<name="sandor"> Sure, you do You’ve got food, you’ve got steel even if you say you don’t And you’ve got women
<name="ray"> What do you want to do? Fight them? Kill them?
<name="ray"> It’d be you against all of them I mean, these people don’t know how to fight
<name="sandor"> You do
<name="ray"> I’m done with fighting
<name="sandor"> Even if it’s to protect yourself?
<name="ray"> Violence is a disease You don’t cure a disease by spreading it to more people
<name="sandor"> You don’t cure it by dying, either
<name="ray"> You’ve done enough work for one day Come on up for some supper
<name="sandor"> It’s gonna be a cold night We’ll need firewood
<name="ray"> I’ll save you a bowl of stew Might even have some ale hidden away
<name="man"> He’s not a lying man He says the Iron Fleet’s in Slaver’s Bay I’m inclined to believe him I’m not going anywhere near those mad fuckers
<name="arya"> You’re Westerosi
<name="man"> What do you care?
<name="arya"> I want to book passage home
<name="man"> You? Can’t afford it
<name="man"> Where’d you steal this from?
<name="arya"> Why do you care?
<name="man"> We leave in two days You can have a hammock in steerage
<name="arya"> I want a cabin And we’ll leave at dawn
<name="arya"> See you at sunrise

<name="sansa"> Yes?
<name="man"> For you, my lady
<name="sansa"> How far is Mole’s Town?
<name="littlefinger"> Sansa Lady Brienne When I heard you had escaped WInterfell, I feared the worst You have no idea how happy I am to see you unharmed
<name="sansa"> Unharmed? What are you doing here?
<name="littlefinger"> I rode north with the Knights of the Vale to come to your aid They’re encamped at Moat Cailin as we speak
<name="sansa"> To come to my aid? Did you know about Ramsay? If you didn’t know, you’re an idiot If you did know, you’re my enemy
<name="sansa"> Would you like to hear about our wedding night? He never hurt my face He needed my face, the face of Ned Stark’s daughter But the rest of me, he did what he liked with the rest of me as long as I could still give him an heir What do you think he did?
<name="littlefinger"> I can’t begin to contemplate -
<name="sansa"> What do you think he did to me?
<name="brienne"> Lady Sansa asked you a question
<name="littlefinger"> He beat you
<name="sansa"> Yes, he enjoyed that What else do you think he did?
<name="littlefinger"> Sansa, I -
<name="sansa"> What else?
<name="littlefinger"> Did he cut you?
<name="sansa"> Maybe you did know about Ramsay all along
<name="littlefinger"> I didn’t know
<name="sansa"> I thought you knew everyone’s secrets
<name="littlefinger"> I made a mistake, a horrible mistake I underestimated a stranger
<name="sansa"> The other things he did, ladies aren’t supposed to talk about those things, but I imagine brothel keepers talk about them all the time I can still feel it I don’t mean in my tender heart it still pains me so I can still feel what he did in my body standing here right now
<name="littlefinger"> I’m so sorry
<name="sansa"> You said you would protect me
<name="littlefinger"> And I will You must believe me when I tell you that I will
<name="sansa"> I don’t believe you anymore I don’t need you anymore You can’t protect me You won’t even be able to protect yourself if I tell Brienne to cut you down And why shouldn’t I?
<name="littlefinger"> Do you want me to beg for my life? If that’s what you want, I will Whatever you ask that is in my power, I will do
<name="sansa"> What if I want you to die here and now?
<name="littlefinger"> Then I will die
<name="sansa"> You freed me from the monsters who murdered my family and you gave me to other monsters who murdered my family Go back to Moat Cailin My brother and I will take back the North on our own I never want to see you again
<name="littlefinger"> I would do anything to undo what’s been done to you I know that I can’t Will you allow me to say one more thing before I go? Your great-uncle Brynden the Blackfish has gathered what remains of the Tully forces and retaken Riverrun You might consider seeking him out The time may come when you need an army loyal to you
<name="sansa"> I have an army
<name="littlefinger"> Your brother’s army
<name="littlefinger"> Half-brother
<name="waif"> You’re not ready You should go home before it’s too late
<name="waif"> You’ll never be one of us, Lady Stark
<name="jaqen"> She has a point
<name="jaqen"> None of the first Faceless Men were born to lords and ladies They began as slaves in the mines of Valyria
<name="arya"> Who was the first?
<name="jaqen"> He was no one The Many-Faced God taught him how to shed his face and how to give the gift The man taught others in exchange for their service Many served, many more gifts were given Soon all the masters and overseers were gone and the Faceless Men fled
<name="arya"> Where did they go?
<name="jaqen"> Here They founded the Free City of Braavos and built this house These were the faces they wore in life when they were not wearing others The first Faceless Men And now a girl is one of them, if a girl desires
<name="arya"> A girl has no desires
<name="arya"> Who?
<name="jaqen"> An actress who calls herself Lady Crane She performs at the theater in Sheelba Square A girl has been given a second chance There will not be a third One way or another, a face will be added to the hall
<name="izembaro"> Ahh
<name="izembaro"> Oh, murdered by a boar The great big hairy whore He dug in his tusks and dug out my guts and soon I am no more
<name="clarenzo"> Oh, come, Father, in bed you must lie I love you, Father Please don’t die
<name="izembaro"> Shut up, you swine! Cersei, more wine
<name="ladyc rane"> I feel the winds of winter as they lick across the land And our son alone on that cold, cold throne without a guiding hand Who will teach him strength? Who will teach him grace? To whom will he turn when it’s time to learn to look darkness in the face?
<name="izembaro"> Ned stark will do fine Now bring me more wine
<name="camello"> Ooh! Ooh, what’s happened here, then?
<name="bobono"> He brought you here, Ned Stark, cause you’re the brightest fellow in the land You should be king of us all and I should be your Hand
<name="camello"> We men of the North are right good hands at keeping people lawful
<name="camello"> I’d ask him for permission, but he smells too bloody awful
<name="izembaro"> I die! I die! And here I now must lie Oh, woe Oh, no Oh, I am about to go
<name="lady crane"> Will you stay on as Joffrey’s Hand?
<name="camello"> The Iron Throne’s what I demand
<name="lady crane"> You cannot
<name="camello"> I can
<name="lady crane"> You will not
<name="camello"> I will
<name="lady crane"> You dare not
<name="camello"> I dare yes
<name="lady crane"> The line of succession
<name="camello"> What’s that mean?
<name="lady crane"> The proper progression
<name="camello"> What’s that mean?
<name="lady crane"> The lawful ascension
<name="camello"> What’s that mean?
<name="camello"> So move along, give me my chair and there won’t be no more trouble
<name="camello"> But we had a deal all done and dusted
<name="camello"> I’m starting to think you can’t be trusted
<name="bianca"> Save my father
<name="lady crane"> Truly you should Killing the man will do you no good
<name="bianca"> Save him, please
<name="lady crane"> Show him mercy Show the people what a good king should be
<name="clarenzo"> Good people, you may all relax My father’s friend shall be spared the
<name="bianca"> Father! No! Oh, father
<name="bobono"> Worry not! All is well I have here a decree from my father Tywin Lannister, the richest man you’ll see He proclaims me Hand of the King The position’s mine for life And he’s give me permission to take Sansa as my wife
<name="bobono"> You’ll learn that what I lack in height I make up for in appetite
<name="bobono"> So let’s forget about your plight, and go rehearse our wedding night
<name="clarenzo"> It’s a wart Two warts I’ve got two fucking warts on my cock
<name="camello"> Well, don’t worry, love They usually go away in five or six years
<name="camello"> Oh, wash this, darling It stinks of me
<name="izembaro"> You can do better, Bianca, dear You must do
<name="bianca"> I had two lines
<name="izembaro"> There are no small parts You rang very false
<name="bianca"> I rang very false?
<name="bobono"> What you need, love, is for someone to ring you true
<name="bianca"> You weren’t complaining about me last night
<name="bobono"> May I get you some wine, Lady Crane?
<name="lady crane"> I’m a rum girl, Bobono You need to know that if we’re going to be intimate
<name="bobono"> Of course we’re going to be intimate
<name="lady crane"> It’s only a matter of time
<name="lady crane"> To our children
<name="bobono"> May they have your talent
<name="lady crane"> And your filthy mind
<name="arya"> A girl will poison the rum Lady Crane is the only one who drinks it
<name="arya"> If a girl could use one of the faces from the hall
<name="jaqen"> A girl is not ready
<name="arya"> She’s a good actress
<name="jaqen"> So a man has heard
<name="arya"> Seems like a decent woman
<name="jaqen"> Does death only come for the wicked and leave the decent behind?
<name="arya"> No Who wants her dead?
<name="jaqen"> That does not matter The price was paid
<name="arya"> The younger actress She’s jealous because Lady Crane is better
<name="jaqen"> A girl must decide if she wants to serve the Many-Faced God
<name="arya"> A girl has decided
<name="jaqen"> A servant does not ask questions
<name="man"> No! No! No
<name="bran"> It was you You made the White Walkers
<name="leaf"> We were at war We were being slaughtered Our sacred trees cut down We needed to defend ourselves
<name="bran"> From whom?
<name="leaf"> From you From men
<name="aeron"> We speak in the presence of the Drowned God In his name we father today to choose a new king as our leader Who makes a claim?
<name="yara"> I am Yara Greyjoy, daughter of Balon Greyjoy, King of the Iron Islands I claim the Salt Throne
<name="man"> We’ve never had a queen Not once
<name="yara"> There are many things we’ve never done We’ve never made our mark upon the world The great lords of Westeros pay us no mind until our little raids buzz through their kingdoms long enough to become a nuisance Then they swat us down They conquer us, humiliate us, and go right back to forgetting we exist
<name="all"> Aye
<name="yara"> We are a sea people
<name="all"> Aye
<name="yara"> Our god is a sea god
<name="all"> Aye
<name="yara"> When I am queen, we will build a fleet that
<name="man"> You shall not be queen
<name="yara"> I am not finished
<name="man"> Yes, you are! A woman will not lead us Not when Balon’s own male heir has returned
<name="theon"> I am Theon Greyjoy last living son of Balon Greyjoy
<name="theon"> And she is your rightful ruler Those of you that have sailed under her, and there are many of you here, you know what she is
<name="all"> Aye
<name="theon"> She is a reaver
<name="all"> Aye
<name="theon"> She is a warrior
<name="all"> Aye
<name="theon"> She is ironborn
<name="all"> Aye
<name="theon"> We will find no better leader This is our queen
<name="euron"> I’m Euron Greyjoy
<name="euron"> I claim the Salt Throne
<name="euron"> Niece
<name="euron"> Nephew Little Theon
<name="euron"> Heard you managed to fuck things right into the ground Captured a castle you couldn’t keep Got yourself taken prisoner Even heard you have no cock
<name="euron"> Explains why you think a woman can be king
<name="yara"> When did you return, Uncle?
<name="euron"> A few days ago I had some things to take care of Long overdue
<name="yara"> I’m glad you’re here Now I know what my first act as queen will be To execute the man who killed my father
<name="euron"> I did I killed him Threw him right over a rope bridge and watched him fall He was leading us nowhere and we would still be heading there if it weren’t for me No one loved him No one wanted to follow him He led ius into two wars we couldn’t win I apologize to you all for not killing him years ago
<name="theon"> That would have been hard to do You weren’t here Last I heard, you were gallivanting around the world having a grand old time
<name="euron"> Gallivanting? That the sort of thing you start to say once your dick gets chopped off?
<name="euron"> Did the great lord of Westeros teach you words like that?
<name="theon"> You were gone Yara was here Being Ironborn Leading Ironborn Getting ready to bring us back to glory
<name="euron"> And how will she do that?
<name="yara"> I will build the largest fleet the world has ever seen
<name="euron"> Right idea, except I’m the one who’s going to build the Iron Fleet because I’m the one who knows how to use it I’ve been all over the world I’ve seen more of it than all of you combined And across the sea there is a person who hates the great lords of Westeros just as much as we do Someone with a large army, three large dragons, and no husband I’m going to build that fleet and I’m going to gallivant right over and give it to Daenerys Targaryen along with my big cock
<name="yara"> You’re going to seduce the Dragon Queen?
<name="euron"> I’m not going to seduce her The Iron Fleet will seduce her And together we’re going to take the Seven Kingdoms I wasn’t born to be king I paid the iron price and here I stand
<name="aeron"> May Euron, your servant, be born again from the sea as you were Bless him with salt Bless him with stone Bless him with steel
<name="aerson"> Listen to the waves Listen to the god He is speaking to us and he says we shall have no king but Euron Greyjoy Let the sea wash your follies and your vanities away Let the old Euron drown Let his lungs fill with seawater
<name="aeron"> Let the fish eat the scales off his eyes
<name="aeron"> What is dead may never die, but rises again harder and stronger
<name="aeron"> What is dead may never die
<name="all"> What is dead may never die
<name="euron"> Where are my niece and nephew? Let’s go murder them
<name="aeron"> They stole our best ships
<name="euron"> Won’t be enough to save them
<name="euron"> Go back to your homes Chop down every tree you can find Quarter-saw the timber and start building I want every man bending planks I want every woman spinning flax for sails Build me a thousand ships and I will give you this world
<name="daenerys"> I banished you twice You came back twice And you saved my life So I can’t take you back and I can’t send you away
<name="jorah"> You must send me away
<name="daenerys"> Is there a cure?
<name="jorah"> I don’t know
<name="daenerys"> How long does it take?
<name="jorah"> I don’t know that either But I’ve seen what happens when it goes far enough I’ll end things before that
<name="daenerys"> I’m sorry I’m so sorry
<name="jorah"> Don’t be All I’ve ever wanted was to serve you Tyrion Lannister was right I love you I’ll always love you Goodbye, Khaleesi
<name="daenerys"> Do not walk away from your queen, Jorah the Andal
<name="daenerys"> You have not been dismissed You pledged yourself to me You swore to obey my commands for the rest of your life
<name="daenerys"> Well, I command you to find the cure wherever it is in this world I command you to heal yourself and then return to me When I take the Seven Kingdoms, I need you by my side
<name="varys"> In the last fortnight since our pact with the Masters, how many killings have been carried out by the Sons of the Harpy?
<name="grey worm"> None
<name="varys"> And how many Masters have been butchered by the free men
<name="grey worm"> Two, but that was the day of the pact Since then, nothing
<name="varys"> So it’s safe to say that a fragile peace has taken hold
<name="grey worm"> For now
<name="varys"> For now is the best we get in our profession
<name="tyrion"> It’s not enough
<name="varys"> Considering the city was on the brink of civil war, I’d say it’s a good start
<name="tyrion"> It’s not enough for Meereen to have peace They need to know Daenerys is responsible for it The Sons of the Harpy have a good story Resist the foreign invaders Our queen has an even better story Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains and all that
<name="missandei"> The people know who brought them freedom
<name="tyrion"> Yes, but do they know who brought them security? Who brought about an end to the violence? We need someone the people trust, someone they know who cannot be bought or influenced
<name="varys"> Sounds like quite the hero Where would we find him?
<name="tyrion"> Who said anything about him”?
<name="man"> You stand in the presence of Kinvara, High Priestess of the Red Temple of Volantis, the Flame of Truth, the Light of Wisdom, the First Servant of the Lord of Light
<name="tyrion"> Welcome to Meereen
<name="tyrion"> That’s about the extent of my Valyrian
<name="tyrion"> Thank you for travelling all this way I know from personal experience how uncomfortable the journey can be
<name="tyrion"> The truth is we need your help We had hoped that we could somehow persuade you to -
<name="kinvara"> You don’t need to persuade me I came to help
<name="kinvara"> Daenerys Stormborn is the one who was promised From the fire she was reborn to remake the world
<name="tyrion"> Yes
<name="kinvara"> She has freed the slaves from their chains and crucified the Masters for their sins
<name="tyrion"> She did indeed
<name="kinvara"> Her dragons are fire made flesh, a gift from the Lord of Light But you heard all this before, haven’t you? On the Long Bridge of Volantis The dragons will purify nonbelievers by the thousands, burning their sins and flesh away
<name="tyrion"> Ideally we’d avoid purifying too many nonbelievers The Mother of Dragons has followers of many different faiths
<name="kinvara"> You want your queen to be worshipped and obeyed And while she’s gone, you want her advisors to be worshipped and obeyed
<name="tyrion"> I’d settle for obeyed
<name="kinvara"> I will summon my most eloquent priests They will spread the word Daenerys has been sent to lead the people against the darkness in this war and in the great war still to come
<name="tyrion"> That sounds most excellent -
<name="varys"> A man named Stannis Baratheon was anointed as the chosen one by one of your priestesses He, too, had a glorious destiny He attacked King’s Landing and was soundly defeated by the man standing beside me Last I had heard, he’d been defeated again, this time at Winterfell and this time for good
<name="tyrion"> We’d be most grateful for any support you could provide the queen
<name="varys"> I suppose it’s hard for a fanatic to admit a mistake Isn’t that the whole point of being a fanatic? You’re always right Everything is the Lord’s will
<name="kinvara"> Everything is the Lord’s will But men and women make mistakes Even honest servants of the Lord
<name="varys"> And you, an honest servant of the lord, why should I trust you to know any more than the priestess who counseled Stannis?
<name="tyrion"> My friend has a healthy skepticism of religion, but we are all loyal supporters of the queen
<name="kinvara"> Everyone is what they are and where they are for a reason Terrible things happen for a reason Take what happened to you, Lord Varys, when you were a child If not for your mutilation at the hand of a second-rate sorcerer, you wouldn’t be here helping the Lord’s Chosen bring his light into the world Knowledge has made you powerful But there’s still so much you don’t know Do you remember what you heard that night when the sorcerer tossed your parts in the fire? You heard a voice call out from the flames Do you remember? Should I tell you what the voice said?
<name="kinvara"> Should I tell you the name of the one who spoke?
<name="kinvara"> We serve the same queen If you are her true friend, you have nothing to fear from me
<name="bran"> What?
<name="bran"> He saw me, the Night King! He saw me! THREE
<name="eyed raven"> He touched you
<name="bran"> I don’t know He was close, but THREE
<name="eyed raven"> He touched you THREE
<name="eyed raven"> He knows you are here He’ll come for you
<name="bran"> But he can’t get in THREE
<name="eyed raven"> He can now His mark is on you You must leave, all of you
<name="meera"> Come on, Hodor Help me with the sledge
<name="hodor"> Hodor
<name="bran"> I’m sorry I didn’t mean to THREE
<name="eyed raven"> The time has come
<name="bran"> The time for what? THREE
<name="eyed raven"> For you to become me
<name="bran"> But am I ready? THREE
<name="eyed raven"> No
<name="jon"> We can’t defend the north from the Walkers and the south from the Boltons If we want to survive, we need Winterfell, and to take Winterfell, we need more men
<name="davos"> Aside from the Starks and the Boltons, the most powerful houses in the North are the Umbers, the Karstarks, and the Manderlys
<name="davos"> The Umbers and the Karstarks have already declared for the Boltons, so we’re not doing so well there
<name="sansa"> The Umbers gave Rickon to our enemies They can hang But the Karstarks declared for Ramsay without knowing they had another choice
<name="davos"> I beg your pardon, my lady, but they know that a Stark beheaded their father I don’t think we can count on them either
<name="sansa"> How well do you know the North, Ser Davos?
<name="davos"> Precious little, my lady
<name="sansa"> My father always said Northerners are different More loyal, more suspicious of outsiders
<name="davos"> They may well be loyal, but how many rose up against the Boltons when they betrayed your family? I may not know the North, but I know men They’re more or less the same in any corner of the world and even the bravest of them don’t want to see their wives and children skinned for a lost cause If Jon’s going to convince them to fight alongside him, they need to believe it’s a fight they can win
<name="jon"> There are more than three other houses in the North Glover, Mormont, Cerwyn, Mazin, Hornwood Two dozen more Together they equal all the others We can start small and build
<name="sansa"> The North remembers They remember the Stark name People will still risk everything for it, from White Harbor to Ramsay’s own door
<name="davos"> I don’t doubt it But Jon doesn’t have the Stark name
<name="sansa"> No, but I do
<name="sansa"> Jon is every bit as much Ned Stark’s son as Ramsay is Roose Bolton’s Ant there are also the Tullys They’re not Northern, but they will back us against the Boltons without question
<name="davos"> I didn’t know the Tullys still had an army
<name="sansa"> My uncle the Blackfish has reformed it and retaken Riverrun
<name="jon"> How do you know that?
<name="sansa"> Ramsay received a raven before I escaped Winterfell
<name="davos"> That’s good The Blackfish is a legend His support would mean a great deal Stark, Tully, a few more houses, almost starts to look like a winning side
<name="brienne"> I’ve sworn to protect you, my lady
<name="sansa"> You heard them We need more men and my uncle has an army
<name="brienne"> We can send the Blackfish a raven
<name="sansa"> Can’t risk Ramsay intercepting it It has to be you
<name="sansa"> Ride for Riverrun My uncle will talk to you and you’ll know how to talk to him
<name="sansa"> What is it?
<name="brienne"> I don’t like leaving you here alone
<name="sansa"> With Jon?
<name="brienne"> Not him He seems trustworthy A bit brooding, perhaps I suppose that’s understandable, considering The others, though Davos and the Red Woman helped a man murder his own brother with blood magic And when Stannis paid for his crime, where were they? Already out looking for a leader with better prospects And that wildling fellow with the beard -
<name="sansa"> Jon isn’t Tormund Jon isn’t Davos, the Red Woman, or Stannis for that matter Jon is Jon He’s my brother He’ll keep me safe I trust him

EPISODE "THE RED WOMAN" - 24/04/2016


<name="watchman"> It’s the Lord Commander
<name="davos"> Help me get him inside
<name="dolorous edd"> Thorne did this
<name="davos"> How many of your brothers do you think you can trust?
<name="dolorous edd"> Trust? The men in this room
<name="davos"> Does the wolf know you?
<name="davos"> We need all the help we can get
<name="melisandre"> Ser Davos
<name="melisandre"> I saw him in the flames, fighting at Winterfell
<name="davos"> I can’t speak for the flames, but he’s gone
<name="male voice"> He was our Lord Commander
<name="male voice"> He never should have been
<name="alliser thorne"> You all know why you’re here Jon Snow is dead NIGHT
<name="watchman"> Who killed him?
<name="alliser thorne"> I did
<name="alliser thorne"> And Bowen Marsh and Othell Yarwyck and the other officers in this castle NIGHT
<name="watchmen"> Murderers! NIGHT
<name="watchman"> Traitors
<name="alliser thorne"> You’re right
<name="alliser thorne"> We’ve committed treason, all of us Jon Snow was my Lord Commander I had no love for him That was no secret But I never once disobeyed an order Loyalty is the foundation on which the Night’s Watch is built, and the Watch means everything to me I have given my life, we have all given our lives to the Night’s Watch Jon Snow was going to destroy the Night’s Watch He let the wildlings through our gates, as no Lord Commander has ever done before He gave them the very land on which they reaved and raped and murdered Lord Commander Snow did what he thought was right, I’ve no doubt about that And what he thought was right would have been the end of us He thrust a terrible choice upon us, and we made it
<name="davos"> He’ll have seen we didn’t come Thorne will have made it official by now Castle Black is his
<name="dolorous edd"> I don’t care who’s sitting at the high table Jon was my friend, and those fuckers butchered him Now we return the favor
<name="davos"> We don’t have the numbers
<name="dolorous edd"> We have a direwolf
<name="davos"> It’s not enough I didn’t know Lord Commander Snow for long, but I have to believe he wouldn’t have wanted his friends to die for nothing
<name="dolorous edd"> If you were planning to see tomorrow, you picked the wrong room We all die today I say we do our best to take Thorne with us when we go
<name="davos"> We need to fight, but we don’t need to die Not if we have help NIGHT
<name="watchman"> Who’s gonna help us?
<name="davos"> You’re not the only ones who owe your lives to Jon Snow
<name="dolorous edd"> Bolt the door Don’t let anyone in I’ll be back as soon as I can
<name="ramsay"> She was 11 the first time I saw her
<name="ramsay"> The kennelmaster’s daughter She smelled of dog I wasn’t much older, but everybody was already afraid of me You certainly were
<name="ramsay"> Myranda wasn’t, though What could I do to her that those hounds couldn’t? She was fearless There was nothing she wouldn’t do
<name="ramsay"> Your pain will be paid for a thousand times over I wish you could be here to watch
<name="maester wolkan"> Shall I have a grave dug for her, my lord? Or would you rather the men build a pyre?
<name="ramsay"> Buried, burned?
<name="ramsay"> This is good meat Feed it to the hounds
<name="roose"> Your command of the cavalry was impressive Thanks to you, the false king Stannis Baratheon is dead Do you know who struck the killing blow?
<name="ramsay"> No
<name="roose"> A shame I’d reward the man Still, a great victory Do you feel like a victor?
<name="roose"> I rebelled against the crown to arrange your marriage to Sansa Stark Do you think that burning wagons in the night and mowing down tired, outnumbered Baratheons is the same as facing a prepared and provisioned Lannister army?
<name="ramsay"> No
<name="roose"> A reckoning will come We need the North to face it The entire North They won’t back us without Sansa Stark We no longer have Sansa Stark You played your games with her You played your games with the heir to the Iron Islands and now they’re both gone
<name="ramsay"> I have a team of men after them with some of my best hounds They won’t get far
<name="roose"> I’m glad to hear it Without Sansa, you won’t be able to produce an heir And without an heir, well
<name="roose"> let’s hope the maesters are right and Lady Walder’s carrying a boy
<name="theon"> We can’t stop
<name="theon"> We have to cross here
<name="sansa"> I can’t
<name="theon"> It’s the only way to throw off the hounds
<name="sansa"> But it’s too cold I can’t I won’t make it I’ll die
<name="theon"> I’ve seen what his hounds do to a person This way is better
<name="theon"> Over here Come on
<name="theon"> Sansa Sansa
<name="theon"> Stay here I’ll lure them away
<name="sansa"> No, I won’t make it without you
<name="theon"> You will Go north, only north Jon is Lord Commander at Castle Black He’ll help you
<name="bolton officer"> Where is Lady Bolton?
<name="theon"> Dead
<name="bolton officer"> Liar
<name="theon"> She broke her leg jumping from the ramparts I left her to die in the snow
<name="bolton officer"> I can’t wait to see what parts Ramsay cuts off you this time dy woman
<name="brienne"> Lady Sansa, I offer my services once again I will shield your back and keep your council and give my life for yours if need be I swear it by the old gods and the new
<name="sansa"> And I vow that you shall always have a place by my hearth and
<name="podrick"> Meat and mead at my table
<name="sansa"> Meat and mead at my table And I pledge to ask no service of you that might bring you dishonor I swear it by the old gods and the new Arise
<name="handmaiden"> Your Grace, I’m sorry to disturb you A ship from Dorne has sailed into the harbor
<name="cersei"> Myrcella
<name="cersei"> Do you remember the first time you saw a dead body?
<name="jaime"> Mother
<name="cersei"> All I could think about when she died was what would happen to her now Every day, every night, what does Mama look like now? Has she started to bloat? Has her skin turned black? Have her lips peeled back from her teeth?
<name="cersei"> I think about locking Myrcella in a crypt
<name="cersei"> I think about her beautiful little face starting to collapse
<name="jaime"> Shh, shh Don’t think about it
<name="cersei"> I have to I have to It’s not right she has to suffer alone
<name="jaime"> She’s not suffering She’s gone No one can hurt her anymore
<name="cersei"> She was good From her first breath, she was so sweet I don’t know where she came from She was nothing like me No meanness, no jealous, just good
<name="jaime"> I know
<name="cersei"> I thought if I could make something so good, so pure maybe I’m not a monster
<name="jaime"> Listen listen to me She was my daughter and I failed her
<name="cersei"> No, I knew this would happen The witch told me years ago She promised me three children She promised me they’d die And gold their shrouds.” Everything she said came true You couldn’t have stopped it It’s prophecy It’s fate
<name="jaime"> You don’t believe that
<name="cersei"> Of course I do You told me yourself when Father died You said we had to stay together You said people would try to tear us apart, take what’s ours That was a prophecy, too I didn’t listen to you, and everything you said came true
<name="septa unella"> The Seven Hells brim with the souls of saintly men They scream in agony and their shame is so great, they do not feel the flames, for now they see if not for a single sin they concealed, they were saved
<name="margaery"> I’d like to see my brother
<name="septa unella"> Confess
<name="margaery"> Please How is he? At least tell me that
<name="septa unella"> Confess
<name="margaery"> I am the queen and I demand to see my brother
<name="septa unella"> Sinners don’t make commands They make confessions
<name="high sparrow"> Septa Unella
<name="high sparrow"> Our other guests need you
<name="high sparrow"> There
<name="high sparrow"> Septa Unella can be overzealous at times I’ll speak with her
<name="margaery"> My brother, can you tell me how he is?
<name="high sparrow"> It isn’t Ser Loras that brings me here Your husband misses you dearly The love between a man and wife is sacred It reflects the love the gods have for all of us But sin leads us away from the sacred And only confession can purge sin
<name="margaery"> I have nothing to confess
<name="high sparrow"> So you believe you are pure? Perfect? Wholly without sin?
<name="margaery"> None of us are
<name="high sparrow"> You have started down the path But you have many miles to go
<name="doran"> I always envied Oberyn He lived He truly lived Sailed around the world Fought men from every country Lay with the most beautiful women alive
<name="ellaria"> And men
<name="doran"> And men He experienced everything, while I sat here in Dorne trying my best to keep my people alive and well fed But that is life We each have our roles
<name="doran"> Oberyn was born to be an adventurer And I was born to rule
<name="ellaria"> The gods are not fools You would have been a lousy adventurer And Oberyn, pfft, he would have been a terrible ruler
<name="doran"> Your mother is a brilliant woman, you know that?
<name="maester"> Prince Doran
<name="doran"> The Princess Myrcella
<name="ellaria"> When was the last time you left this palace? You don’t know your own people Their disgust for you Elia Martell raped and murdered, and you did nothing Oberyn martell butchered, and you did nothing You’re not a Dornishman You’re not our prince
<name="doran"> My son Trystane
<name="ellaria"> Your son is weak just like you And weak men will never rule Dorne again
<name="trystane"> I told you I’m not hungry
<name="obara"> We’re not here to feed you
<name="obara"> We’re here to kill you
<name="nymeria"> You want her to do it or me?
<name="trystane"> We are family I don’t want to hurt you
<name="nymeria"> Her or me?
<name="nymeria"> Good
<name="obara"> Smart boy
<name="nymeria"> You’re a greedy bitch, you know that?
<name="tyrion"> We’re never going to fix what’s wrong with this city from the top of an 800-foot pyramid
<name="tyrion"> We’ll be fine We’re dressed like common merchants
<name="varys"> You walk like a rich person
<name="tyrion"> You’ve spent a lot of time studying the way rich people walk?
<name="varys"> You walk as though the paving stones were your personal property I used to steal from people like you when I was a boy
<name="tyrion"> It’s a good thing you’re not a boy anymore because you have no cock
<name="tyrion"> For your baby To eat
<name="varys"> She thinks you want to eat her baby
<name="varys"> His Valyrian is terrible He only wants to give you money, so your baby can eat
<name="varys"> Mhysa means mother in Valyrian
<name="tyrion"> I know what mhysa means
<name="varys"> Who wrote it?
<name="tyrion"> Hard to know Our queen is not as popular in Meereen as she used to be
<name="varys"> The Sons of the Harpy?
<name="tyrion"> Very possibly Daenerys Targaryen took away their most valuable property, told them human beings weren’t even property to begin with You can see why they’re unhappy Of course, it could also be the freed men
<name="listeners"> For the night is dark and full of terrors
<name="red priest"> The Lord of Light sent the Mother of Dragons to you, and those who love the darkness chased her away
<name="tyrion"> Many of the former slaves feel that Daenerys has abandoned them
<name="varys"> She did fly away on a dragon and not come back
<name="red priest"> How will you respond? Will you wring your hands, while you wait for the Mother of Dragons to return? Or will you you take up her flames yourselves? Will you fight for your own salvation, now that Queen Daenerys is not here to fight for you?
<name="tyrion"> It’s a problem
<name="tyrion"> Fear has brought Meereen to a standstill Whoever you are, wherever you go, someone in this city wants to murder you We can’t fight an enemy we don’t know
<name="varys"> The Sons of the Harpy planned their attack in the fighting pits very carefully, which means they take orders from someone
<name="tyrion"> And have you started looking for that someone?
<name="varys"> My little birds have already taken wing Soon they’ll return, singing songs of men in gold masks
<name="tyrion"> Well, we won’t be sailing to Westeros anytime soon
<name="daario"> Goat?
<name="jorah"> Ram
<name="daario"> You think our friend got him?
<name="jorah"> Don’t know anything else that can melt a ram’s horn
<name="daario"> We’re on the right path, then
<name="daario"> Perhaps she’s tired of being queen I don’t think she likes it very much
<name="jorah"> She’s too smart to like it
<name="daario"> Maybe she’s flown somewhere else, somewhere far away from men like us
<name="jorah"> I’ve been all over the world There’s no escaping men like us
<name="daario"> There’s no escaping her, eh? You keep coming back Why?
<name="jorah"> You know why
<name="daario"> isn’t it frustrating wanting someone who doesn’t want you back?
<name="jorah"> Of course it is
<name="daario"> You’re a romantic I admire that Sometimes I look at you and I think, So that’s what I’ll be like when I grow old
<name="jorah"> If you grow old
<name="daario"> If I grow old I hope I do I want to see what the world looks like when she’s done conquering it
<name="jorah"> So do I
<name="daario"> Huh, an army?
<name="jorah"> Not an army A horde
<name="daario"> Dothraki?
<name="jorah"> They have her
<name="bloodrider"> Maybe she saw a ghost My friend’s mother saw a ghost and her hair turned white
<name="bloodrider"> Pink people are afraid of the sun It burns their skin This one stands too long in the sun and her hair goes white
<name="bloodrider"> You think she’s got white pussy hair too? You ever been with a girl with white pussy hair?
<name="bloodrider"> Only when I was fucking your grandma
<name="bloodrider"> I’ll ask Khal Moro for a night with you What do you think?
<name="bloodrider"> Pretty eyes, but she’s an idiot
<name="bloodrider"> She doesn’t have to be smart to get fucked in the ass
<name="bloodrider"> I like to talk when I’m finished Otherwise, we might as well be dogs
<name="bloodrider"> For you, my Khal The white-haired girl we found in the hills
<name="bloodrider"> Look at those lips, blood of my blood
<name="wife"> Blue-eyed women are witches
<name="wife"> It is known
<name="wife"> Cut off her head, before she casts a spell on you
<name="khal moro"> Even if I was blind, I’d hear my wives say, Cut off her head” and I’d know this woman was beautiful I’m glad I’m not blind Seeing a beautiful woman naked for the first time, what is better than that?
<name="bloodrider"> Killing another Khal?
<name="khal moro"> Yes, killing another Khal
<name="bloodrider"> Conquering a city and taking her people as slaves, and taking her idols back to Vaes Dothrak
<name="bloodrider"> Breaking a wild horse, forcing it to submit to your will
<name="khal moro"> Seeing a beautiful woman naked for the first time is among the five best things in life
<name="daenerys"> Do not touch me
<name="daenerys"> I am Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, the Unburnt, Queen of Meereen, Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar of the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons
<name="khal moro"> You are nobody, the millionth of your name, Queen of Nothing, slave of Khal Moro Tonight I will lie with you, and if the Great Stallion is kind, you will give me a son Do you understand?
<name="daenerys"> I will not lie with you And I will bear no children, for you, or anyone else Not until the sun rises in the west, and sets in the east
<name="wife"> I told you she was a witch Cut off her head
<name="khal moro"> I like her She has spirit
<name="daenerys"> I was wife of Khal Drogo, son of Khal Bharbo
<name="khal moro"> Khal Drogo is dead
<name="daenerys"> I know I burnt his body
<name="khal moro"> Forgive me I did not know It is forbidden to lie with a Khal’s widow No one will touch you You have my word
<name="daenerys"> If you will escort me back to Meereen, I will see that your khalasar is given a thousand horses, as a sign of my gratitude
<name="khal moro"> When a Khal dies, there is only one place for his Khaleesi
<name="wife"> Vaes Dothrak The Temple of the Dosh Khaleen
<name="wife"> To live out her days with the widows of dead Khals It is known
<name="arya"> Thank you
<name="waif"> Are you listening, blind girl? Do you hear them talking? Do any of them talk to you? No So sad
<name="waif"> Stand and fight, blind girl
<name="arya"> I can’t see
<name="waif"> That’s your problem, not mine
<name="waif"> See you tomorrow
<name="alliser thorne"> Ser Davos, we have no cause to fight We are both anointed knights
<name="davos"> Hear that, lads? Nothing to fear
<name="alliser thorne"> I will grant amnesty to all brothers who thrown down their arms before nightfall And you, Ser Davos, I will allow you to travel south, a free man with a fresh horse
<name="davos"> And some mutton I’d like some mutton
<name="alliser thorne"> What?

<name="pycelle"> Later Go away
<name="girl"> Grand Maester
<name="high sparrow"> Ser Loras Tyrell Are you prepared to stand trial and profess your guilt or innocence before the Seven?
<name="loras"> There’ll be no need for a trial I confess before the Seven and freely admit to my crimes
<name="high sparrow"> To which crimes will you be confessing?
<name="loras"> All of them I lay with other men including the traitor Renly Baratheon
<name="loras"> I perjured myself before the gods I am guilty of depravity dishonesty, profligacy, and arrogance I see that now I humble myself before the Seven and accept whatever punishment the gods deem just
<name="high sparrow"> The gods’ judgment is fierce, but also fair The Warrior punishes those who believe themselves beyond the reach of justice But the Mother shows her mercy to those who kneel before her
<name="loras"> I take full responsibility for my many sins and unburden myself of my desires My only remaining wish is to devote my life to the Seven May I be a living example of their grace for others to witness
<name="high sparrow"> You understand fully what this means?
<name="loras"> I do I will abandon the Tyrell name and all that goes with it I will renounce my lordship and my claims on Highgarden I will never marry and I will never father children
<name="high sparrow"> Brother Loras

<name="high sparrow"> Go to the Red Keep and show her the way
<name="lancel"> Get the others
<name="pycelle"> Where’s the king?
<name="qyburn"> Elsewhere, I’m afraid
<name="pycelle"> What’s the meaning of this? I was told that I have more important things to do with my time than waste them in the presence-
<name="qyburn"> Please, Grand Maester I bear you no ill will Please forgive me if you can
<name="qyburn"> This pains me, my lord Whatever your faults, you do not deserve to die alone in such a cold, dark place But sometimes before we can usher in the new, the old must be put to rest
<name="lancel"> The longer you wait, the worse it’ll be for you
<name="lancel"> What are you doing?
<name="margaery"> There’s something wrong
<name="high sparrow"> You have nothing to fear, Your Grace The trial will begin shortly
<name="margaery"> Cersei is not here Tommen is not here Why do you think they are not here?
<name="high sparrow"> If the accused is not here, she will be tried regardless We cannot escape the justice of the gods-
<name="margaery"> Forget about the bloody gods and listen to what I’m telling you Cersei understands the consequences of her absence and she is absent anyway, which means she does not intend to suffer those consequences The trial can wait We all need to leave

<name="cersei"> Confess Confess
<name="septa unella"> No
<name="cersei"> Confess
<name="cersei"> Confess It felt good Beating me, starving me, frightening me, humiliating me You didn’t do it because you cared about my atonement You did it because it felt good I understand I do things because they feel good I drink because it feels good I killed my husband because it felt good to be rid of him I fuck my brother because it feels good to feel him inside me I lie about fucking my brother because it feels good to keep our son safe from hateful hypocrites I killed your High Sparrow and all his little sparrows all his septons, all his septas, all his filthy soldiers, because it felt good to watch them burn It felt good to imagine their shock and their pain No thought has ever given me greater joy Even confessing feels good under the right circumstances
<name="cersei"> You’ve always been quiet
<name="cersei"> I said my face would be the last thing you saw before you died Do you remember?
<name="septa unella"> Good I’m glad to see your face I’m ready to meet the gods

<name="jaime"> You’re welcome to her
<name="bronn"> She doesn’t want me She wants your golden fingers up her twat
<name="jaime"> Those two have their eyes on you
<name="bronn"> They have their eyes on you, cunt

<name="bronn"> Fuck it
<name="bronn"> No need to call me ser just because I’m an anointed knight
<name="walder"> This came together rather well Your father would be pleased
<name="jaime"> I’m sure he would be
<name="walder"> Edmure is back in a cell Can’t go killing my son by law It wouldn’t be right Give the family a bad name
<name="walder"> So the famous Blackfish killed by footsoldiers, eh? Legendary warrior, everyone said
<name="jaime"> Have you done much fighting yourself, Lord Frey?
<name="walder"> I’m a bit old for all that
<name="jaime"> No, but back in your day
<name="walder"> The purpose of fighting is defeating your enemies, isn’t it?
<name="walder"> I’ve defeated mine Riverrun belonged to House Tully for a thousand years Now it’s mine What do you call that? Victory
<name="jaime"> Yes, you’re a great conqueror
<name="walder"> Go on, mock me, boy You think I mind? The Tullys mocked me for years The Starks mocked me Where are they now? You talk about war as if you’re an expert but the one battle I remember you fighting, you were captured by Robb Stark, the Young Wolf But it doesn’t matter Here we are now, two kingslayers We know what it’s like to have them grovel to our faces and snigger behind our backs We don’t mind, do we? Fear is a marvelous thing
<name="jaime"> They don’t fear the Freys, though They fear the Lannisters We gave you the Riverlands to hold the Riverlands If we have to ride north and take them back for you every time you lose them, why do we need you?
<name="cersei"> Show me
<name="qyburn"> Your Grace, there’s no need-
<name="cersei"> Show me
<name="qyburn"> What are your thoughts concerning the king’s funeral? As the Sept of Baelor is no longer an option, perhaps a ceremony in the throne room?
<name="cersei"> He should be with his grandfather, his brother, his sister Burn him and bury his ashes where the sept once stood
<name="sam"> Hello
<name="sam"> From Lord Commander Snow at Castle Black
<name="sam"> I’m I’m to be the new maester
<name="maester"> Oh
<name="maester"> According to our records, Jeor Mormont is Lord Commander
<name="sam"> He died
<name="maester"> We received no report from the maester at Castle Black
<name="sam"> Maester Aemon became quite ill shortly after the election He’s since passed away Which is why I’m here
<name="maester"> This is irregular
<name="sam"> Yes, well, I suppose that life is irregular
<name="maester"> The archmaester will discuss these irregularities with you In the meantime, you are permitted to use the library Follow me
<name="maester"> No women or children
<name="jon"> When we had feasts, our family would sit up here and I’d sit down there
<name="melisandre"> Could have been worse, Jon Snow You had a family You had feasts
<name="jon"> Aye, you’re right I was luckier than most
<name="jon"> What is that?
<name="davos"> Tell him Tell him who it belonged to
<name="melisandre"> The Princess Shireen
<name="davos"> Tell him what you did to her Tell him
<name="melisandre"> We burned her at the stake
<name="davos"> Why?
<name="melisandre"> The army was trapped The horses were dying It was the only way
<name="davos"> You burned a little girl alive
<name="melisandre"> I only do what my Lord commands
<name="davos"> If he commands you to burn children, your Lord is evil
<name="melisandre"> We are standing here because of him Jon Snow is alive because the Lord willed it
<name="davos"> I loved that girl like she was my own She was good She was kind And you killed her
<name="melisandre"> So did her father So did her mother Her own blood knew it was the only way
<name="davos"> The only way for what? They all died anyway! You told everyone Stannis was the one You had him believing it, all of them fooled And you lied
<name="melisandre"> I didn’t lie I was wrong
<name="davos"> Aye, you were wrong How many died because you were wrong?
<name="davos"> I ask your leave to execute this woman for murder She admits to the crime
<name="jon"> Do you have anything to say for yourself?
<name="melisandre"> I’ve been ready to die for many years If the Lord was done with me, so be it, but he’s not You’ve seen the Night King, Jon Snow You know the great war is still to come You know the army of the dead will be upon us soon And you know I can help you win that war
<name="jon"> Ride south today If you return to the North, I’ll have you hanged as a murderer
<name="davos"> If you ever come back this way, I will execute you myself
<name="jon"> I’m having the lord’s chamber prepared for you
<name="sansa"> Mother and Father’s room? You should take it
<name="jon"> I’m not a Stark
<name="sansa"> You are to me
<name="jon"> You’re the Lady of Winterfell You deserve it We’re standing here because of you The battle was lost until the Knights of the Vale rode in They came because of you You told me Lord Baelish sold you to the Boltons
<name="jon"> And you trust him?
<name="sansa"> Only a fool would trust Littlefinger I should have told you about him, about the Knights of the Vale I’m sorry
<name="jon"> We need to trust each other We can’t fight a war amongst ourselves We have so many enemies now
<name="sansa"> Jon
<name="sansa"> A raven came from the Citadel A white raven Winter is here
<name="jon"> Well, Father always promised, didn’t he?
<name="olenna"> The last time a Tyrell came to Dorne, he was assassinated 100 red scorpions, was it?
<name="ellaria"> You have nothing to fear from us, Lady Olenna
<name="olenna"> You murder your own prince, but you expect me to trust you?
<name="obara"> We invited you to Dorne because we needed your help You came to Dorne because you needed our help?
<name="olenna"> What is your name again? Barbaro?
<name="obara"> Obara
<name="olenna"> Obara You look like an angry little boy Don’t presume to tell me what I need
<name="nymeria"> Forgive my sister What she lacks in diplomacy, she makes-
<name="olenna"> Do shut up, dear
<name="olenna"> Anything from you?
<name="olenna"> No? Good Let the grown women speak
<name="ellaria"> The Lannisters have declared war on House Tyrell They have declared war on Dorne We must be allies now if we wish to survive
<name="olenna"> Cersei stole the future from me She killed my son She killed my grandson She killed my granddaughter Survival is not what I’m after now
<name="ellaria"> You’re absolutely right I chose the wrong words It is not survival I offer It is your heart’s desire
<name="olenna"> And what is my heart’s desire?
<name="ellaria"> Vengeance Justice
<name="varys"> Fire and blood
<name="daario"> Your ships are nearly ready I saw them painting the sails
<name="daario"> I’m curious to see how the Dothraki do on the poison water
<name="daenerys"> You’re not coming with us
<name="daario"> New strategy? You want the Second Sons to attack from the west coast? If we take Casterly Rock, the Lannisters will have nowhere to run when you hit King’s Landing
<name="daenerys"> You’re not going to Westeros You’re staying here with the Second Sons There’s finally peace in Meereen You will keep the peace while the people choose their own leaders
<name="daario"> Fuck Meereen Fuck the people I’m here for you, not them
<name="daenerys"> You promised me My sword is yours My life is yours.” This is what I command If I’m going to rule in Westeros, I’ll need to make alliances The best way to make alliances is with marriage
<name="daario"> Who are you marrying this time?
<name="daenerys"> I don’t know Maybe no one
<name="daario"> But you need to lure all the noble houses to the table? Are you a queen or fish bait?
<name="daenerys"> I can’t bring a lover to Westeros
<name="daario"> A king wouldn’t think twice about it
<name="daenerys"> So that’s what you want? To be my mistress?
<name="daario"> I’m not proud I don’t care what perfumed aristocrat sits beside you in the throne room I don’t want a crown I want you
<name="daario"> I love you And I make you happy You know I do Bring me with you Let me fight for you
<name="daenerys"> I can’t
<name="daario"> The dwarf told you to do this
<name="daenerys"> No one tells me to do anything
<name="daario"> Clever fellow Can’t argue with his logic I’m no use to you over there
<name="daenerys"> Don’t get angry
<name="daario"> I’m not angry I’m full of self-pity Who comes after you? Who can ever follow Daenerys Stormborn, the Mother of Dragons?
<name="daenerys"> A great number of women, I imagine Specific orders will be left for you regarding the welfare of Meereen and the Bay of Dragons
<name="daario"> Bay of Dragons?
<name="daenerys"> We can’t call it Slaver’s Bay anymore, can we?
<name="daario"> You’ll get that throne you want so badly, I’m sure of it I hope it brings you happiness
<name="daario"> I pity the lord of Westeros They have no idea what’s coming for them
<name="daenerys"> Farewell, Daario Naharis
<name="tyrion"> How did he take it?
<name="daenerys"> No tears
<name="tyrion"> I know it was hard for you You turned away a man who truly loves you because he would have been a liability in the Seven Kingdoms That’s the kind of self-sacrifice that makes for a good ruler, if it’s any consolation
<name="daenerys"> It’s not
<name="tyrion"> No, I suppose not I’m terrible at consoling
<name="daenerys"> Yes, you really are
<name="tyrion"> All right, how about the fact that this is actually happening? You have your armies, you have your ships, you have your dragons Everything you’ve ever wanted since you were old enough to want anything It’s all yours for the taking Are you afraid?
<name="tyrion"> Good You’re in the great game now And the great game’s terrifying The only people who aren’t afraid of failure are madmen like your father
<name="daenerys"> Do you know what frightens me? I said farewell to a man who loves me A man I thought I cared for And I felt nothing Just impatient to get on with it
<name="tyrion"> He wasn’t the first to love you and he won’t be the last
<name="daenerys"> Well, you have completely failed to console me
<name="tyrion"> For what it’s worth, I’ve been a cynic for as long as I can remember Everyone’s always asking me to believe in things family, gods, kings, myself It was often tempting until I saw where belief got people So I said no, thank you to belief And yet here I am
<name="tyrion"> I believe in you It’s embarrassing, really I’d swear you my sword, but I don’t actually own a sword
<name="daenerys"> It’s your counsel I need
<name="tyrion"> It’s yours Now and always
<name="daenerys"> Good I, um I had something made for you I’m not sure if it’s right
<name="daenerys"> Tyrion Lannister, I name you Hand of the Queen
<name="walder"> You’re not one of mine, are you?
<name="handmaiden"> No, my lord
<name="walder"> Didn’t think so Too pretty
<name="walder"> Where are my damn moron sons? Black Walder and Lothar promised to be here by midday
<name="handmaiden"> They’re here, my lord
<name="walder"> Well, what are they doing, trimming their cunt hairs? Tell them to come here now
<name="handmaiden"> But they’re already here, my lord
<name="handmaiden"> Here, my lord
<name="handmaiden"> They weren’t easy to carve Especially Black Walder
<name="walder"> What
<name="arya"> My name is Arya Stark I want you to know that The last thing you’re ever going to see is a Stark smiling down at you as you die
<name="littlefinger"> Forgive me, my lady if you’re at prayer
<name="sansa"> I’m done with all that I came here every day when I was a girl I prayed to be somewhere else Back then I only ever thought about what I wanted, never about what I had
<name="sansa"> I was a stupid girl
<name="littlefinger"> You were a child
<name="sansa"> What do you want?
<name="littlefinger"> I thought you knew what I wanted
<name="sansa"> I was wrong
<name="littlefinger"> No, you weren’t Every time I’m faced with a decision, I close my eyes and see the same picture Whenever I consider an action, I ask myself will this action help to make this picture a reality? Pull it out of my mind and into the world? And I only act if the answer is yes A picture of me on the Iron Throne and you by my side
<name="sansa"> It’s a pretty picture
<name="littlefinger"> News of this battle will spread quickly through the Seven Kingdoms I’ve declared for House Stark for all to hear
<name="sansa"> You’ve declared for other houses before, Lord Baelish It’s never stopped you from serving yourself
<name="littlefinger"> The past is gone for good You can sit here mourning its departure or you can prepare for the future You, my love, are the future of House Stark Who should the North rally behind? A trueborn daughter of Ned and Catelyn Stark born here at Winterfell or a motherless bastard born in the south?
<name="benjen"> This is where I leave you
<name="meera"> You’re not coming with us?
<name="benjen"> The Wall is not just ice and stone Ancient spells were carved into its foundations Strong magic to protect men from what lies beyond And while it stands, the dead cannot pass I cannot pass
<name="meera"> Where will you go?
<name="benjen"> The great war is coming and I still fight for the living I’ll do what I can as long as I can
<name="bran"> Thank you, Uncle Benjen
<name="benjen"> I wish you both good fortune
<name="meera"> Are you sure you’re ready for this?
<name="bran"> I’m the Three-Eyed Raven now I have to be ready for this
<name="lyanna"> Ned?
<name="ned"> Lyanna
<name="lyanna"> Is that you? Is that really you?
<name="lyanna"> You’re not a dream
<name="ned"> No, I’m not a dream I’m here Right here
<name="lyanna"> I’ve missed you, big brother
<name="ned"> I’ve missed you, too
<name="lyanna"> I want to be brave
<name="ned"> Shh You are
<name="lyanna"> I’m not
<name="lyanna"> I don’t want to die
<name="ned"> You’re not going to die
<name="ned"> Get her some water
<name="lyanna"> No, no water
<name="ned"> Is there a maester?
<name="lyanna"> Please Listen to me, Ned
<name="lyanna"> If Robert finds out, he’ll kill him, you know he will You have to protect him Promise me, Ned Promise me
<name="lyanna"> Promise me, Ned Promise me
<name="vale knight"> You can’t expect Knights of the Vale to side with wildling invaders
<name="tormund"> We didn’t invade We were invited
<name="vale knight"> Not by me
<name="jon"> The free folk, the northerners, and the Knights of the Vale fought bravely, fought together, and we won My father uses to say we find our true friends on the battlefield
<name="man"> The Boltons are defeated The war is over Winter has come If the maesters are right, it’ll be the coldest one in a thousand years We should ride home and wait out the coming storms
<name="jon"> The war is not over And I promise you, friend, the true enemy won’t wait out the storm He brings the storm
<name="lyanna"> Your son was butchered at the Red Wedding, Lord Manderly But you refused the call You swore allegiance to House Stark, Lord Glover, but in their hour of greatest need, you refused the call And you, Lord Cerwyn, your father was skinned alive by Ramsay Bolton Still you refuse the call But House Mormont remembers The North remembers We know no king but the King in the North whose name is Stark I don’t care if he’s a bastard Ned Stark’s blood runs through his veins He’s my king from this day until his last day
<name="manderly"> Lady Mormont speaks harshly and truly My son died for Robb Stark, the Young Wolf I didn’t think we’d find another king in my lifetime I didn’t commit my men to your cause cause I didn’t want more Manderlys dying for nothing But I was wrong Jon Snow avenged the Red Wedding He is the White Wolf ing in the North
<name="glover"> I did not fight beside you on the field and I will regret that until my dying day A man can only admit when he was wrong and ask forgiveness
<name="jon"> There’s nothing to forgive, my lord
<name="glover"> There will be more fights to come House Glover will stand behind House Stark as we have for a thousands years And I will stand behind Jon Snow the King in the North

<name="jon"> I was a prisoner of the Wildlings But we avenged him I want you to know that every mutineer found justice
<name="jorah"> I cant think of a worse way for him to go The Nights Watch was his life He would have died to protect every one of those men, and they butchered him
<name="jon"> I hate that he died that way My father was the most honorable man I ever met He was good all the way through And he died on the executioners block

<name="sansa"> I remember
<name="arya"> One time the boys were shooting arrows with Ser Rodrick I came out here after and Bran had left his bow behind just lying on the ground Ser Rodrick would have cuffed him if he saw There was one arrow in the target There was no one around, just like now No one to stop me So I started shooting And every shot I had to go out there and get my one arrow and walk back and shoot it again I wasnt very good Finally I hit the bullseye It could have been the 20th shot or the 50th I dont remember But I hit the bullseye and I heard this starts a slow clap
<name="arya"> I looked up and hes standing right here smiling down at me I knew what I was doing was against the rules But he was smiling so I knew it wasnt wrong The rules were wrong I was doing what I was meant to be doing and he knew it Now hes dead Killed by the Lannisters with your help turns to look at ARYA

<name="sansa"> They forced me to do it
<name="arya"> Did they With a knife at your throat? Did they put you on a rack and stretch you until your bones started to pop?
<name="sansa"> You dont know what it was like I was a child
<name="arya"> So was I I would have let them kill me before I betrayed my family
<name="sansa"> They told me it was the only way to save father
<name="arya"> And you were stupid enough to believe them I remember you standing on that platform with Joffrey and Cersei when they dragged father too the block I remember the pretty dress you were wearing I remember the fancy way you did your hair
<name="sansa"> You were there?
<name="arya"> I was there standing in the crowd near Baelors statue
<name="sansa"> And what did you do? Did you come running to the rescue? Did you fight off the Lannisters and save father?

<name="sansa"> Do you know how happy Cersei would be if she saw us fighting? This is exactly what she wants This is what shes always wanted, to tear us apart -
<name="arya"> The northern lords will read it They wouldnt think much of Lady Sansa if they knew how she did Cerseis bidding What would little Lyanna Mormont say? Shes younger than you were when you wrote this Are you going to say, But I was just a child ?

<name="beric"> Of course I did When he was Hand he sent me off hunting for The Mountain Your Wildling friend told me the red woman brought you back Thoros has brought me back six times We both serve the same lord
<name="jon"> I serve the north
<name="beric"> The north didnt raise you from the dead
<name="jon"> The lord of light never spoke to me I dont know anything about him I dont know what he wants from me
<name="beric"> He wants you alive
<name="jon"> Why?
<name="beric"> I dont know
<name="jon"> Thats all anyone can tell me, I dont know So whats the point in serving a god that none of us knows what he wants
<name="beric"> I think about that all the time I dont think its our purpose to understand except one thing Were soldiers We have to know what were fighting for Im not fighting so some man or woman I barely know can sit on a throne made of swords
<name="jon"> So what are you fighting for?
<name="beric"> Life Death is the enemy The first enemy and the last
<name="jon"> But we all die
<name="beric"> The enemy always wins And we still need to fight him Thats all I know You and I wont find much joy while were here But we can keep others alive We can defend those who cant defend themselves
<name="jon"> I am the shield that guards the realms of men
<name="beric"> Maybe we dont need to understand any more than that Maybe thats enough
<name="jon"> Aye Maybe thats enough stops and looks into the distance There is a steep mountain ascending into the clouds in the distance
<name="sandor"> Thats what I saw in the fire points towards the mountain
<name="sandor"> A mountain like an arrowhead
<name="thoros"> Are you sure turns to THOROS and nods his head
<name="sandor"> Were getting close The men start walking towards the base of the mountain TYRION is sitting in a chair staring into the fire stands across the room next to the painted table
<name="daenerys"> Do you know what I like about you turns to look at DAENERYS

<name="tyrion"> Oh Ive been heroic on occasion DAENERYS walks over to the fire and sits in the chair opposite fro
<name="tyrion"> I once charged through the mud gate of Kings Landing
<name="daenerys"> I dont want you to be a hero Heroes do stupid things and they die Drogo, Jorah, Dario, even this Jon Snow, they all try to outdo each other of who can do the stupidist, bravest thing

<name="walder frey"> Youre wonder why I brought you all here After all, we just had a feast Since when does old Walder give us two feasts in a single fortnight?
<name="walder frey"> Well, its no good being lord of the Riverlands if you cant celebrate with your family Thats what I say
<name="walder frey"> Ive gathered every Frey who means a damn thing so I can tell you my plans for this great house now that winter has come But first, a toast! No more of that Dornish horse piss! This is the finest Arbor gold! Proper wine for proper heroes
<name="waldery frey"> Stand together
<name="all"> Stand together
<name="walder"> Not you Im not wasting good wine on a damn woman
<name="walder"> Maybe Im not the most pleasant man Ill admit it But Im proud of you lot Youre my family, the men who helped me slaughter the Starks at the Red Wedding
<name="walder"> Yes, yes Cheer Brave men, all of you Butchered a woman pregnant with her babe Cut the throat of a mother of five Slaughtered your guests after inviting them into your home But you didnt slaughter every one of the Starks
<name="walder"> No, no, that was your mistake You should have ripped them all out, root and stem
<name="walder"> Leave one wolf alive and the sheep are never safe
<name="arya"> When people ask you what happened here, tell them the North remembers Tell them winter came for House Frey
<name="edd"> You wildlings?
<name="meera"> Im Meera Reed, daughter of Howland Reed This is Brandon Stark, son of Ned Stark
<name="edd"> How do I know thats true?
<name="bran"> You were at the Fist of the First Men You were at Hardhome Youve seen the Army of the Dead Youve seen the Night King Hes coming for us For all of us
<name="edd"> Okay, come on Lets get them inside
<name="jon"> I want every northern maester to scour their records for any mention of dragonglass Dragonglass kills white walkers Its more valuable to us now than gold We need to find it, we need to mine it, we need to make weapons from it Everyone aged 10 to 60 will drill daily with spears, pikes, bow and arrow
<name="robett"> Its about time we taught these boys of summer how to fight
<name="jon"> Not just the boys
<name="jon"> We cant defend the North if only half the population is fighting
<name="robett"> You expect me to put a spear in my granddaughters hand?
<name="lyanna"> I dont plan on knitting by the fire while men fight for me I might be small, Lord Glover, and I might be a girl, but I am every bit as much a Northerner as you
<name="robett"> Indeed you are, my lady No one has questioned-
<name="lyanna"> And I dont need your permission to defend the North
<name="lyanna"> Well begin training every man, woman, boy, and girl on Bear Island
<name="jon"> While were preparing for attack, we need to shore up our defenses The only thing standing between us and the Army of the Dead is the Wall and the Wall hasnt been properly manned in centuries Im not the king of the Free Folk
<name="jon"> But if were going to survive this winter together.
<name="tormund"> You want us to man the castles for you?
<name="jon"> Last time we saw the Night King was at Hardhome The closest castle to Hardhome is Eastwatch-by-the-Sea
<name="tormund"> Then thats where Ill go Looks like were the Nights Watch now
<name="jon"> If they breach the wall, the first two castles in their path are Last Hearth and Karhold
<name="yohn"> The Umbers and the Karstarks betrayed the North Their castles should be torn down with not a stone left standing
<name="sansa"> The castles committed no crimes And we need every fortress we have for the war to come We should give the Last Hearth and Karhold to new families, loyal families who supported us against Ramsay
<name="all"> Aye
<name="jon"> The Umbers and the Karstarks have fought beside the Starks for centuries Theyve kept faith for generation after generation
<name="sansa"> And then they broke faith
<name="jon"> Im not going to strip these families of their ancestral homes because of the crimes of a few reckless sons
<name="sansa"> So theres no punishment for treason and no reward for loyalty?
<name="jon"> The punishment for treason is death Smalljon Umber died on the field of battle Harald Karstark died on the field of battle
<name="sansa"> They died fighting for Ramsay Give the castles to the families of the men who died fighting for you
<name="jon"> When I was Lord Commander of the Nights Watch I executed men who betrayed me I executed men who refused to follow orders My father always said, The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword, and I have tried to live by those words But I will not punish a son for his fathers sins, and I will not take a family home away from a family it has belonged to for centuries That is my decision, and my decision is final
<name="jon"> Ned Umber
<name="jon"> Alys Karstark
<name="jon"> For centuries, our families fought side by side on the battlefield I ask you to pledge your loyalty once again to House Stark, to serve as our bannermen and come to our aid whenever called upon
<name="jon"> Stand
<name="jon"> Yesterdays wars dont matter anymore The North needs to band together, all the living north Will you stand beside me, Ned and Alys, now and always? NED
<name="alys"> Now and always
<name="jon"> You are my sister, but I am king now
<name="sansa"> Will you start wearing a crown?
<name="jon"> When you question my decisions in front of the other lords and ladies, you undermine me
<name="sansa"> So I cant question your decisions anymore?
<name="jon"> Of course you can, but-
<name="sansa"> Joffrey never let anyone question his authority You think he was a good king?
<name="jon"> Do you think Im Joffrey?
<name="sansa"> Youre as far from Joffrey as anyone Ive ever met
<name="jon"> Thank you
<name="sansa"> Youre good at this, you know
<name="jon"> At what?
<name="sansa"> At ruling
<name="jon"> No
<name="sansa"> You are You are They respect you, they really do, but you have to-
<name="sansa"> Why are you laughing?
<name="jon"> What did father used to say? Everything before the word but is horse shit
<name="sansa"> He never said that to me
<name="jon"> No No, he never cursed in front of his girls
<name="sansa"> Because he was trying to protect us He never wanted us to see how dirty the world really is, but Father couldnt protect me and neither can you Stop trying
<name="jon"> All right, Ill stop trying to protect you and you stop trying to undermine me
<name="sansa"> Im not trying to undermine you
<name="sansa"> You have to be smarter than Father You need to be smarter than Robb I loved them, I miss them, but they made stupid mistakes, and they both lost their heads for it
<name="jon"> And how should I be smarter? By listening to you?
<name="sansa"> Would that be so terrible?
<name="wolkan"> A raven from Kings Landing, Your Grace
<name="jon"> Cersei of House Lannister, First of Her Name, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms
<name="sansa"> What does she want?
<name="jon"> Come to Kings Landing Bend the knee or suffer the fate of all traitors
<name="sansa"> Youve been so consumed with the enemy to the north, youve forgotten about the one to the south
<name="jon"> Im consumed with the Night King because Ive seen him And believe me, youd think of little else if you had, too
<name="sansa"> We still have a wall between us and the Night King Theres nothing between us and Cersei
<name="jon"> Theres a thousand miles between us and Cersei Winter is here The Lannisters are a southern army Theyve never ranged this far north
<name="sansa"> Youre the military man, but I know her If youre her enemy, shell never stop until shes destroyed you Everyone whos ever crossed her, shes found a way to murder
<name="jon"> You almost sound as if you admire her
<name="sansa"> I learned a great deal from her
<name="jaime"> What is this?
<name="cersei"> Its what weve been waiting for our whole lives Its what Father trained us for, whether he knew it or not
<name="jaime"> He knew it Made me memorize every damn city, town, lake, forest, and mountain
<name="cersei"> Its ours now, we just have to take it
<name="cersei"> Youve been quiet since you came home Are you angry with me?
<name="jaime"> No, not angry
<name="cersei"> Are you afraid of me?
<name="jaime"> Should I be?
<name="cersei"> Daenerys Targaryen has chosen Tyrion to be her Hand Right now, theyre sailing across the Narrow Sea, hoping to take back her fathers throne Our little brother, the one you love so much, the one you set free, the one who murdered our father and our first-born son, now he stands beside our enemies and gives them counsel Hes out there somewhere at the head of an armada Where will they land?
<name="jaime"> Dragonstone
<name="jaime"> They have deep-water ports for the ships Stannis left the castle unoccupied, and thats where she was born
<name="cersei"> Enemies to the east
<name="cersei"> Enemies to the south Ellaria Sand and her brood of bitches
<name="cersei"> Enemies to the west Olenna, the old cunt Another traitor
<name="cersei"> Enemies to the north Ned Starks bastard has been named King in the North and that murdering whore Sansa stands beside him Enemies everywhere Were surrounded by traitors Youre in command of the Lannister army now How do we proceed?
<name="jaime"> Winter is here We cant win a war if we cant feed our men and our horses The Tyrells have the grain, the Tyrells have the livestock
<name="cersei"> Will the Tyrell bannermen stand alongside a Dothraki horde and Unsullied slave soldiers?
<name="jaime"> If they think Daenerys will win No one wants to fight on the losing side Right now, we look like the losing side
<name="cersei"> Im the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms
<name="jaime"> Three kingdoms, at best Im not sure you understand how much danger were in
<name="cersei"> I understand were in a war for survival I understand whoever loses dies I understand whoever wins could launch a dynasty that lasts a thousand years
<name="jaime"> A dynasty for whom? Our children are dead Were the last of us
<name="cersei"> A dynasty for us, then
<name="jaime"> We never talked about Tommen
<name="cersei"> Theres nothing to say
<name="jaime"> Our baby boy killed himself
<name="cersei"> He betrayed me He betrayed us both Should we spend our days mourning the dead mother, father, and all our children?
<name="jaime"> Cersei-
<name="cersei"> I loved them I did But theyre ashes now and were still flesh and blood Were the last Lannisters, the last ones who count
<name="jaime"> Even Lannisters cant survive without allies Where are our allies now? You saw what happened to Walder Frey and his family
<name="cersei"> I heard How could we ever trust a man like that?
<name="jaime"> We couldnt He was a useless, old coward, but the Freys supported us Now theyre all dead Whoever killed them is no friend of ours We need allies Stronger, better allies We cant win this war alone
<name="cersei"> You think I listened to Father for 40 years and learned nothing?
<name="jaime"> The Greyjoys? You invited the Greyjoys to Kings Landing?
<name="cersei"> Not all of them
<name="jaime"> Well, it looks like all of them
<name="cersei"> I invited Euron Greyjoy, the new King of the Iron Islands You said yourself we needed stronger, better allies There you are
<name="jaime"> How are they better allies? How are they different from the Freys? They both broke their promises and murdered their former friends as soon as it suited them
<name="cersei"> So does everyone when it suits them Unlike the Freys, they have ships And theyre good at killing
<name="jaime"> Theyre not good at anything I know the Ironborn Theyre bitter, angry little people All they know how to do is steal things they cant build or grow themselves
<name="cersei"> Euron Greyjoy didnt come here for that
<name="jaime"> Oh, what did he come here for, then?
<name="cersei"> A queen
<name="euron"> The moment I was chosen Lord of the Iron Islands, they turned on me Their own uncle They stole my best ships and ran Sailed the right across the world and gave them to the Dragon Queen so she could bring her armies here to attack you
<name="euron"> Its nothing compares to the treason you suffered at the hands of a family members, from what I hear But still, it bothers me Murdering them would make me feel a lot better And since it appears that all our treasonous family members are fighting for the same side, I thought we rightful monarchs could murder them together
<name="jaime"> Youre not a rightful monarch, though, are you?
<name="jaime"> The Greyjoys rebelled agains the throne for the right to be monarchs, but as I recall, you were soundly defeated Come to mention it, werent you the one who started that rebellion by sailing to Casterly Rock and burning the Lannister fleet? You certainly caught us there Very smart move on your part Of course, we all made it to the Iron Islands anyway I was there
<name="euron"> I remember very well I saw you I heard so much talk The best in the world No one can stop him I didnt believe it, to be honesty But I must say, when you rushed through the breach and started cutting people down it was glorious Like a dance
<name="jaime"> The people I was cutting down were your own kin
<name="euron"> The place was getting crowded I enjoyed watching it I truly did
<name="jaime"> And I enjoyed killing Greyjoys
<name="euron"> A good thing for me If you hadnt crushed us, I wouldnt have gone into exile If I hadnt done that, I wouldnt be the greatest captain on the 14 seas
<name="cersei"> If not the most humble
<name="euron"> Youre not humble Youre the queen of a great nation You dont care about the Iron Islands Theyre nothing but rocks and bird shit and and a lot of very unattractive people The Iron Fleet, on the other hand, thats something else entirely Its the greatest armada Westeros has ever seen With the Iron Fleet, you own the seas You can defeat the invaders of the east and the pretenders of the north and south
<name="cersei"> What do you want in return?
<name="euron"> Ever since I was a little boy, I wanted to grow up and mary the most beautiful woman in the world So here I am, with a thousand ships and two good hands
<name="cersei"> I decline your proposal
<name="euron"> Why?
<name="cersei"> Youre not trustworthy Youve broken promises to allies before and murdered them at the nearest opportunity You murdered your own brother
<name="euron"> You should try it Feels wonderful
<name="euron"> I dont expect you to trust me outright You need proof of my honest intentions In my experience, the surest way to a womans heart is with a gift A priceless gift I wont return to Kings Landing until I have that for you
<name="marwyn"> Ah, Maester Weyland A drinkers liver if ever I saw one
<name="marwyn"> Weigh that
<name="marwyn"> The triumph of transitory pleasures Mankinds curse
<name="sam"> Archmaester, I was wondering.
<name="marwyn"> Whats the weight?
<name="sam"> Um, 147
<name="sam"> I was wondering if you had considered my proposition
<name="marwyn"> I dont remember your proposition
<name="sam"> I asked you if, in light of what Ive seen in the North, if I could have access to the restricted area of the library
<name="marwyn"> That area is reserved for maesters Are you a maester?
<name="sam"> No
<name="marwyn"> Not a very strong proposition, is it?
<name="sam"> Archmaester, with respect, Ive seen them the Army of the Dead The white walkers W was sent here to learn how to defeat them, but everyone in the Citadel, those who will even talk to me, they all doubt the walkers ever existed in the first place
<name="marwyn"> Everyone in the Citadel doubts everything Its their job But the tales of the Long Night cant be pure fabrication Too many similarities from unconnected sources
<name="sam"> Sources in the restricted area?
<name="marwyn"> The very same And the simplest explanation for your grating obsession with the white walkers is that youre telling the truth and that you saw what you say you saw
<name="sam"> So, you believe me
<name="marwyn"> I do Youll finish weighing that heart?
<name="sam"> That makes you the only person south of the Twins who does
<name="marwyn"> Were not lie the people south of the Twins And were not like the people north of the Twins In the Citadel, we lead different lives for different reasons We are this worlds memory, Samwell Tarly Without us, men would be little better than dogs Dont remember any meal but the last, cant see forward to any but the next And every time you leave the house and shut the door, they howl like youre gone forever When Roberts Rebellion was raging, people that the end was near The end of the Targaryen dynasty How will we survive? When Aegon Targaryen turned his eye westward and flew his dragons to Blackwater Rush The end is near! How will we survive? And thousands of year before that, during the Long Night, we can forgive them for thinking it truly was the end But it wasnt None of it was The Wall has stood through it all And every winter that ever came has ended
<name="marwyn"> Be a good lad Clean this up
<name="brienne"> Nope
<name="brienne"> Nope
<name="tormund"> Youre a lucky man
<name="littlefinger"> Ive heard she beat the Hound in single combat Shes a very impressive woman
<name="sansa"> What do you want, Lord Baelish?
<name="littlefinger"> I want you to be happy I want you to be safe
<name="sansa"> I am safe Im at home, surrounded by friends I have Brienne to protect me from anyone who would harm me
<name="littlefinger"> What about happy? Why arent you happy? What do you want that you do not have?
<name="sansa"> At the moment, peace and quiet
<name="sansa"> No need to seize the last word, Lord Baelish Ill assume it was something clever
<name="littlefinger"> My lady
<name="littlefinger"> My lady
<name="brienne"> Why is he still here?
<name="sansa"> We need his men Without the Vale, Ramsay Bolton would still hold this castle Littlefinger saved us
<name="brienne"> He wants something
<name="sansa"> I know exactly what he wants
<name="man"> He rode through the streets of the city / Down from his hill on high / Oer the winds and the steps and the cobble / He rode to a womans sigh / For she was his secret treasure / She was his shame and his bliss / And a chain and a keep are nothing / Compared to a womans kiss / For hands of gold are always cold / But a womans hands are warm / For hands of gold are always cold / But a womans hands are-
<name="arya"> Thats a pretty song Ive never heard it before
<name="man"> Its a new one
<name="man"> Are you hungry? Weve got some rabbit
<name="arya"> I dont want to steal your food
<name="man"> Youre not stealing, were offering Come on, its gonna be a cold night
<name="man"> You heading south?
<name="arya"> Kings Landing
<name="man"> Poor girl
<name="arya"> Not so bad, is it?
<name="man"> Depends on your taste, I guess If you like your streets covered in shit and pigs blood, its the town for you
<name="man"> All my life, I wanted to see the Red Keep, the Sept of Baelor, the Dragonpit Then when I finally make it, they wouldnt let me within a mile of the Red Keep, the Sept of Baelors blown to hell, and the Dragonpit is a damn ruin
<name="man"> The people who live there, theyd skin you alive if they could make two coppers off your hide
<name="man"> Worst place in the world
<name="arya"> What are you doing in the Riverlands?
<name="man"> Theres been some trouble with the Freys up at The Twins, so were part of the army thats been sent to keep the peace
<name="man"> Here you go Guests first
<name="arya"> Oh, no, I couldnt You dont have enough
<name="man"> My mother always told me to be kind to strangers Strangers will be kind to you
<name="arya"> Youre a long way from home Im sure youve had some adventures, though
<name="man"> Yeah, endless adventures Theyll be singing about us for a thousand years MAN 3; The truth is when we left home, we couldnt wait to get away But now weve been gone a while, we cant wait to get home
<name="man"> I just think about my dad out there on his boat all alone I ought o be out there with him
<name="man"> My wifes just had our first baby
<name="arya"> Boy or girl?
<name="man"> Oh, who knows? You think soldiers get ravens with news from home?
<name="man"> I hope its a girl
<name="arya"> Why?
<name="man"> Girls take care of their papas when their papas grow old Boys just go off to fight in someone elses wars
<name="man"> Are you old enough to drink?
<name="man"> Its blackberry wine I made it myself
<name="arya"> Its really good
<name="man"> So, why is a nice girl on her own heading to Kings Landing?
<name="arya"> Im going to kill the queen
<name="thoros"> Bad night to be outdoors
<name="sandor"> Youve got real powerful magic to figure that out Did the Lord of Light whisper that in your ear? Its snowing, Thoros Its windy Its gonna be a cold night
<name="thoros"> Youre a grouchy old bear, arent you, Clegane? You want some rum?
<name="sandor"> Dont like that shit Its too sweet
<name="thoros"> Why are you always in such a foul mood?
<name="sandor"> Experience
<name="beric"> This seems like a good place to spend the night
<name="sandor"> These people dont want us here
<name="beric"> Seems deserted to me No livestock No smoke coming from the chimney
<name="sandor"> I dont like the look of it
<name="thoros"> For a big, hard man, you scare easy
<name="sandor"> Ill tell you what doesnt scare me bald cocksuckers like you You think youre fooling anyone with that top knot? Bald cunt

<name="beric"> How do you think it ended for them?
<name="sandor"> With death
<name="beric"> Girl died in her fathers arms Both of them covered in blood and a knife at their feet Id say they were starving And rather than letting his little girl suffer, he ended it for both of them
<name="sandor"> Doesnt matter now
<name="beric"> No, doesnt matter now
<name="sandor"> Ive known you a long time, Dondarrion
<name="beric"> Aye I think the first time we met was at that tournament-
<name="sandor"> And I always thought you were dull as dirt
<name="sandor"> Youre not bad I dont hate you Dont like, but youre not bad
<name="beric"> Thank you, Clegane That warms the heart
<name="sandor"> But theres nothing special about you
<name="beric"> Youre right about that
<name="sandor"> So why does the Lord of Light keep bringing you back? Ive met better men than you, and theyve been hanged from crossbeams, or beheaded, or just shat themselves to death in a field somewhere None of them came back So, why you?
<name="beric"> You think I dont ask myself that? Every hour of every day? Why am I here? What am I supposed to do? What does the Lord see in me?
<name="sandor"> And?
<name="beric"> I dont know I dont understand our Lord
<name="sandor"> Your Lord
<name="beric"> I dont know what He wants from me I only know that He wants me alive
<name="sandor"> If hes so all-powerful, why doesnt he just tell you what the fuck he wants?
<name="thoros"> Clegane
<name="thoros"> Come over here Dont worry The fire wont bite I want to show you something
<name="sandor"> Its my fucking luck I end up with a band of fire worshippers
<name="beric"> Aye Almost seems like divine justice
<name="sandor"> Theres no divine justice, you dumb cunt If there was, youd be dead and that girl would be alive
<name="sandor"> What do you want?
<name="thoros"> Look into the flames
<name="sandor"> I dont want to look in the damn flames

<name="daenerys"> burn down your homes, murder you and orphan your children Thats Cersei Lannister, not me Im not here to murder And all I want to destroy is the wheel that is rolled over rich and poor to the benefit of no one but the Cersei Lannisters of the world I offer you a choice Bend the knee and join me Together we will leave the world a better place than we found it, or refuse and die A few Lannister men kneel to the ground, while most remain standing DROGON roars and moves closer to the men Almost all the Lannister men quickly kneel while a few still remain standing including RANDYLL and DICKON TARLEY speaks to RANDYLL
<name="daenerys"> Step forward, My Lord RANDYLL takes several steps toward and stands in front of the kneeling Lannister men
<name="daenerys"> You will not kneel?
<name="randyll"> I already have a queen
<name="tyrion"> My sister, she wasnt your queen until recently though, was she, until she murdered your rightful queen and destroyed House Tyrell for all time So it appears your allegiances are somewhat flexible
<name="randyll"> There are no easy choices in war Say what you will about your sister, she was born in Westeros, has lived here all her life You on the other hand, you murdered your own father and chose to support a foreign invader One with no ties to this land, an army of savages at her back
<name="daenerys"> You will not trade your honor for your life I respect that turns to speak to DAENERYS
<name="tyrion"> Perhaps he could take the black, Your Grace Whatever else he is, he is a true soldier He would be invaluable at the Wall
<name="randyll"> You cannot send me to the Wall You are not my queen DAENERYS turns to look at her Dothraki escort The Dothraki walk forward to collect RANDYLL As the men are pulling RANDYLL awa steps forward
<name="dickon"> You will have to kill me too pulls away from the Dothraki and turns to face his son
<name="randyll"> Step back and shut your mouth
<name="daenerys"> Who are you?
<name="randyll"> A stupid boy
<name="dickon"> Im Dickon Tarley, son of Randyll Tarley
<name="tyrion"> You are the future of your house This war has already wiped one great house from the world Dont let it happen again Bend the knee looks to RANDYLL RANDYLL nods to his son
<name="dickon"> I will not turns to speak to DAENERYS He speaks softly so no one but the queen can hear
<name="tyrion"> Your Grace, nothing strips bold notions from a mans head like a few weeks in a dark cell
<name="daenerys"> I meant what I said Im not here to put men in chains If that becomes an option many will take it I gave them a choice They made it
<name="tyrion"> Your Grace, if you begin beheading entire families -
<name="daenerys"> Im not beheading anyone pauses and looks over the DROGON DRGON roars and shakes his head and flexes his wings
<name="tyrion"> Your Grace looks to her Dothraki escort and gives a signal The men grab RANDYLL and DICKON and walk them over to DROGON RANDYLL takes DICKON by the arm
<name="daenerys"> Lord Randyll Tarley, Dickon Tarley, I, Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of my name, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons, sentence you to die pauses a moment and looks at RANDYLL and DICKON
<name="daenerys"> Dracarys DROGON draws a deep breath and begins spewing dragonfire at the two men They are instantly engulfed in flames They both collapse into ash after a few seconds There are two craters left where RANDYLL and DICKON stood The Lannister men recoil in horror Any Lannister soldier that was still standing kneels to the ground DAENERYS silently turns and begins to walk off the battlefield HALLWAY JAIME is quickly walking down the hall leading to CERSEIs room As he approaches exits the queens chambers
<name="qyburn"> My Lord JAIME passes by QYBURN without saying a word and barges int s quarters stand and walks over to JAIME
<name="cersei"> How many men did we lose?
<name="jaime"> We havent done a full counting
<name="cersei"> Its armies that win wars We have the Tyrell gold, we have the Iron Bank behind us We can buy mercenaries
<name="cersei"> Theyre not the same as our men but theyll fight if theyre well paid, which they will be
<name="jaime"> I just saw the Dothraki fight Theyll beat any mercenary army Theyll beat any army Ive ever seen Killing our men wasnt war for them, it was sport Her dragon burned a thousand wagons Qyburns scorpion fired bolts bigger than you They couldnt stop it And she has three of them This isnt a war we can win
<name="cersei"> So what do we do? Sue for peace? I sit on her fathers throne, the father you betrayed and murdered And in her mind shes winning What sort of offer do you think shed make turns and walks away from JAIME
<name="cersei"> Maybe we can count on Tyrion to intercede on our behalf by way of apology for murdering our father and our son
<name="jaime"> He didnt
<name="cersei"> You saw the crossbow, you saw his body walks across the room to where CERSEI is standing
<name="jaime"> Im not talking about father Tyrion didnt kill Joffrey He had nothing to do with it
<name="cersei"> After all this time it still amazes me -
<name="jaime"> It was Olenna She confessed before she died
<name="cersei"> And this was before or after she drank the poison you so kindly provided her?
<name="jaime"> After
<name="cersei"> And you believed her?
<name="jaime"> If you were Olenna would you rather have seen your granddaughter married to Joffrey or Tommen? Which one would Margerey been better able to control? Which one would have made Olenna the true ruler of the Seven Kingdoms? She was telling the truth looks away, then sits down
<name="cersei"> I shouldnt have listened to you She should have died screaming
<name="jaime"> Shes dead like her son, her grandchildren, her whole house And if we dont find a way out of this war well follow them
<name="cersei"> So we fight and die or we submit and die I know my choice A soldier should know his
<name="cut to"> DRAGONSTONE CLIFFS JON SNOW is standing on the edge of a cliff looking towards the ocean DROGON roars and flies over him wit on his back DROGON lands next to JON and charges towards him DROGON opens his jaws and roars in JONs face DROGON creeps closer until he is inches from JON JON removes his glove and slowly extends his hand toward DROGON DROGON lowers his head and allows JON to touch him looks surprised and steps down from her mount DROGON turns and flies away
<name="daenerys"> Theyre beautiful, arent they?
<name="jon"> That wasnt the word I was thinking of, but, yes, they are Gorgeous beasts
<name="daenerys"> Theyre not beasts to me No matter how big they get, how terrifying to everyone else, theyre my children DAENERYS turns to look at her three dragons as they fly over Dragonstone in the distance
<name="jon"> You werent gone long turns back to JON
<name="daenerys"> No
<name="jon"> And?
<name="daenerys"> And I have fewer enemies today than I did yesterday JON pauses and doesnt say anything
<name="daenerys"> Youre not sure how you feel about that?
<name="jon"> No, Im not turns and starts walking towards the castle, JON follows
<name="daenerys"> How many men did your army kill taking Winterfell back from the Boltons?
<name="jon"> Thousands
<name="daenerys"> We both want to help people We can only help them from a position of strength Sometimes strength is terrible When you first came here Ser Davos said you took a knife in the heart for your people
<name="jon"> Ser Davos gets carried away
<name="daenerys"> So it was a figure of speech? JON doesnt say anything A group of Dothraki guards approach DAENERYS and speak in their native tongue
<name="guard"> This man says he is your friend, Khaleesi The guard steps to the side and JORAH MORMONT stands behind him answers the guard in Dothraki
<name="daenerys"> He is my friend kneels before DAENERYS
<name="jorah"> Your Grace
<name="daenerys"> Jon Snow, this is Ser Jorah Mormont, an old friend
<name="jon"> I served with your father He was a great man JORAH nods to JON
<name="daenerys"> You look strong You found a cure?
<name="jorah"> I wouldnt be here if I hadnt I return to your service, my queen, if youll have me
<name="daenerys"> It would be my honor DAENERYS steps forward and hugs JORAH
<name="cut to"> A group of ravens are resting on a tree Several of the ravens eyes wash white They take off and fly over Winterfell They cross frozen fields and over a snowy mountain They arrive at The Wall at Eastwatch-by-the-sea and continue over the Wall The ravens fly many miles over tundra and more mountains The birds crest a hill and thousands of dead men can be seen marching south A group of riders and the Night King are on top of an outcrop watching the dead file past As the ravens approach the Night King peers in their direction and the birds scatter and disperse s eyes are pure white They wash back to their normal color He is sitting in front of the Weirwood Maester Wolkan stands next to him
<name="bran"> Ravens We need to send ravens WOLKAN nods his head to BRAN
<name="cut to"> CITADEL MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER ARCHMAESTER MARWYN and other citadel maesters are seated at a council table MARWYN has a raven scroll in his hand and the maesters are discussing the contents SAMWELL enters the room carrying a large stock of books and scrolls MARWYN points SAM to a nearby table to offload the books
<name="maester"> I put very little stock in it myself Prophecies of doom are never in short supply, especially when winter comes
<name="marwyn"> I remember Wolkan A bit timid but a sharp mind
<name="maester"> The north has dulled many good maesters wits Im not sure if its the cold, the drink, or the company All the maesters chuckle
<name="maester"> A crippled boy claims to have seen dead men on the march beyond the wall thanks to the magical help of a raven with three eyes SAM stops working and turns around
<name="marwyn"> It is a bit much Still we ought to -
<name="sam"> Brandon Stark The maesters all turn in their seats to look a
<name="sam"> the crippled boy
<name="marwyn"> Do you know him?
<name="sam"> I let him through the Wall years ago I saw him go beyond the wall
<name="marwyn"> And?
<name="sam"> Somehow a crippled boy survived for years beyond the wall when no one else could Not the Nights Watch, not the Wildlings, no one Perhaps we ought to listen to what he has to say
<name="maester"> Perhaps you need more scribing work to discipline your mind
<name="marwyn"> I sense a more detailed proposal is forthcoming steps forward and clears his throat
<name="sam"> Everyone in Westeros trusts and respects you If you tell people the threat is real theyll believe it If you advise all the lords to send their men north to hold the wall theyll do it And if you tell every maester in the Citadel to search every word of every faded scroll about the long night, they may find something that lets us defeat the Army of the Dead for good
<name="marwyn"> It could be done And this news could be authentic Its possible Its also possible this message is part of a ploy by the dragon queen to lure southern armies away from the lands they are currently defending to open those lands to easy conquest
<name="maester"> That does seem far more likely than magic birds talking to cripples
<name="sam"> Archmaester, please Its real Ive seen it
<name="marwyn"> We will write to Maester Wolkan at Winterfell for clarification I promise you we will get to the truth of it one way or another
<name="sam"> Archmaester -
<name="marwyn"> That will be all, Tarley SAM turns to collect his work and leave The maesters begin talking to one another
<name="maester"> It brings to mind the work of Davy Moonstone, the charlatan who claimed to see the children of the forest The maesters all chuckle
<name="maester"> Dont forget the Prophet Lodock that promised the Drowned God would rise up and destroy Aegon the Conquerer The maesters continue laughing SAMWELL gets the last of his work and walks out of the door in disgust turns to look at MARWYN
<name="maester"> Is he the one whose father and brother were just burned alive?
<name="marwyn"> Im afraid so
<name="maester"> Horrible business
<name="marwyn"> I dont have the heart to tell him yet Hes a good lad crumples the raven scroll and throws it dismissevely on the table
<name="marwyn"> Right The ravenry was falling apart last time I checked VARYS an are sitting on the stairs of the Throne Room alone VARYS has a sealed raven scroll in his hand tapping it on the stone is drinking a glass of wine having a discussion with VARYS
<name="tyrion"> All rulers demand that people bend the knee Its why theyre rulers She gave Tarley a choice A man who had taken up arms against her What else could she do?
<name="varys"> Not burn him alive alongside his son
<name="tyrion"> I am her hand, not her head I cant make her decisions for her
<name="varys"> Thats what I used to tell myself about her father I found the traitors but I wasnt the one burning them alive I was only a purveyor of information reaches over to TYRIONs cup of wine, picks it up and begins to drink from it He grimaces as he drinks
<name="varys"> Its what I told myself when I watched them beg for mercy, Im not the one doing it As the pitch of their screams rose higher, Im not the one doing it When their hair caught fire and the smell of the burning flesh filled the Thone Room, Im not the one doing it VARYS drinks again and sets the cup down next t picks it up
<name="tyrion"> Daenerys is not her father
<name="varys"> And she never will be with the right counsel You need to find a way to make her listen looks down at the note in VARYSs hand
<name="tyrion"> Who is that for?
<name="varys"> Jon Snow
<name="tyrion"> Did you read it?
<name="varys"> Its a sealed scroll for the King in the North pauses and drinks from his cup of wine
<name="tyrion"> Whats it say?
<name="varys"> Nothing good DAENERYS and VARYS are seated at the painted table TYRION and JORAH stand near the queen DAVOS an SNOW are standing on the other end of the table is holding a raven scroll and reading it
<name="jon"> I thought Arya was dead I thought Bran was dead
<name="daenerys"> Im happy for you You dont look happy
<name="jon"> Bran saw the Night King and his army marching towards Eastwatch If they make it past the wall -
<name="varys"> The Wall has kept them out for thousands of years Presumably interrupts VARYS
<name="jon"> I need to go home
<name="daenerys"> You said you dont have enough men
<name="jon"> Well fight with the men we have Unless youll join us
<name="daenerys"> And give the country to Cersei? As soon as I march away she marches in
<name="tyrion"> Perhaps not Cersei thinks the Army of the Dead is nothing but a story made up by wet nurses to frighten children What if we prove her wrong?
<name="jon"> I dont think shell come see the dead at my invitation begins walking around the table closer to JON
<name="tyrion"> So bring the dead to her
<name="daenerys"> I thought that was what we are trying to avoid
<name="tyrion"> We dont have to bring the whole army Only one soldier
<name="davos"> Is that possible?
<name="jon"> The first White I ever saw was brought into Castle Black from beyond the Wall
<name="tyrion"> Bring one of these things down to Kings Landing and show her the truth
<name="varys"> Anything you bring back will be useless unless Cersei grants us an audience and is somehow convinced not to murder us the moment we set foot in the capital
<name="tyrion"> The only person she listens to is Jaime He may listen to me
<name="daenerys"> And how would you get into Kings Landing Everyone in the room stops and looks a
<name="davos"> I can smuggle you in, but if the Goldcloaks were to recognize you, Im warning you, Im not a fighter TYRION nods his head
<name="daenerys"> Well, it will all be for nothing if we dont have one of these dead men
<name="varys"> Fair point How do you propose to find one? JON pauses and stares at the ground breaks the silence
<name="jorah"> With the queens permission Ill go north and take one DAENERYS turns to look a
<name="jorah"> You asked me to find a cure so I could serve you Allow me to serve you
<name="jon"> The free folk will help us They know the real north better than anyone
<name="davos"> They wont follow Ser Jorah
<name="jon"> They wont have to
<name="davos"> You cant lead a raid beyond the wall Youre not in the Nights Watch anymore Youre King in the North
<name="jon"> Im the only one here whose fought them Im the only one here who knows them
<name="daenerys"> I havent given you permission to leave
<name="jon"> With respect, Your Grace, I dont need your permission I am a king And I came here knowing that you could have your men behead me or your dragons burn me alive I put my trust in you, a stranger, because I knew it was the best chance for my people, for all our people Now Im asking you to trust in a stranger because its our best chance DAENERYS pauses for a moment then nods her head in agreement THE GREAT HALL Northen lords includin GLOVER, YOHN ROYCE and are congregated in the Great Hall ARYA walks into the room and hears a loud discussion The lords are adressing SANSA who is seated at the head table
<name="robett"> ing in the North should stay in the north We did not choose you to rule us, My Lady, but perhaps we should have The men agree in unison ROYCE stands up and walks in front of SANSA
<name="yohn"> nights of the Vale came here for you, Lady Stark
<name="sansa"> Youre very kind, my lords, but Jon is our king He is doing what he thinks is best The men sit down and everyone in the hall begins talking to one another HALL and ARYA are walking through the hall t s quarters having a discussion
<name="sansa"> I warned Jon this would happen He cant leave the north and expect it to just sit and wait for him like Ghost
<name="arya"> He didnt He trusted you to hold it for him
<name="sansa"> Well, hes not making it easy The northern lords are proud The girls arrive at SANSAs quarters is glancing around the room
<name="arya"> These are mother and fathers chambers
<name="sansa"> And?
<name="arya"> Nothing
<name="sansa"> Dont do that SANSA turns around to fac
<name="arya"> What?
<name="sansa"> Say what you mean
<name="arya"> You always liked nice things It made you feel better than everyone drops the papers in her hand on a table and looks at ARYA
<name="sansa"> Are you angry with me?
<name="arya"> They were insulting Jon and you sat there and listened
<name="sansa"> I listened to their complaints, which is my responsibility as Lady of Winterfell
<name="arya"> Their opinions are important to you?
<name="sansa"> Glover has 500 men Royce has 2,000 Offend them and Jon loses his army
<name="arya"> Not if they lose their heads first
<name="sansa"> Winterfell didnt just fall into our hands We took it back, and the Mormonts and the Hornwoods and the Wildlings and the Vale, all of us working together Now, Im sure cutting off heads is very satisfying, but thats not the way you get people to work together
<name="arya"> And if Jon doesnt come back, youll need their support, so you can work together to give you what you really want
<name="sansa"> How can you even think such a horrible thing?
<name="arya"> Youre thinking it right now You dont want to be, but the thought just wont go away and ARYA stare at each in silence for a moment

<name="tyrion"> He was going to execute me He knew I was innocent He didnt hate me because of anything I did, he hated me because of what I am The little monster sent to punish him Do you think I wanted to be born this way? Did he think I chose -
<name="jaime"> What do you want?
<name="tyrion"> Daenerys will win this war Youre a military man You must know there is no way around it Daenerys is not her father Shes even willing to suspend hostilities if Cersei agrees to certain terms
<name="jaime"> You want Cersei to bend the knee you can ask her yourself
<name="tyrion"> I I dont Daenerys doesnt Not right now anyway She has a more important request FLEA BOTTOM Men are in the market selling their wares A blacksmith sharpens a sword on a grinding wheel is walking through the market glancing around A man in a blacksmith shop pulls a sword from the fire and begins to hammer it on his anvil walks into the shop
<name="davos"> I wasnt sure Id find you The blacksmith puts the sword down and turns around, revealing GENDRY, the bastard son of Robert Baratheon
<name="davos"> I thought you might still be rowing GENDRY chuckles an smiles
<name="davos"> I looked in shops, taverns, brothels I should have known to come straight to the Street of Steel

<name="davos"> Fermented crab One bucket of this triples the brothels earnings for the week A man thinks hes done, hes ready to go back to his loving family, but before he gets his britches up his lady of the hour pops a tiny spoon of that into his mouth Five minutes later, hes back in the race Here, have a taste scoops up a bit of fermented crab and offers it to the guards Both men reach out and take a pinch The guards sniff the crab and put it in their mouth They both recoil from the taste and look at each other
<name="davos"> Id hurry to your favorite establishment or youll put a whole in that chainmail The guards and DAVOS laugh The guards turn and start walking back towards the city GENDRY nods at them as they go TYRION appears at the top of the stairs leading to the beach The Goldcloaks see him as hes walking down the path TYRION walks by the guards and they exchange glances The guards stop and turn back toward the boat
<name="guard"> Oi, Dwarf quickly walks to cut the guards off
<name="davos"> I really wouldnt try anymore until you see how the first bite hits you
<name="guard"> That dwarf The guards blow past DAVOS and begin talking to TYRION
<name="guard"> Where did you get that scar?
<name="tyrion"> Fish hook Some men you just cant teach
<name="guard"> We was looking for a dwarf with a scar like that awhile back is still standing behind the guards He retrieves his gold pouch again and holds it up shaking it
<name="davos"> Perhaps theres some arrangement? The two guards turn back to DAVOS
<name="guard"> Arrangement? You gonna arrange to pay us more than Queen Cersei? GENDRY can be seen behind the backs of the guards He slowly retrieves his hammer and creeps up behind GUARD 2 He swings his hammer and connects with the side of the guards head The man drops As GENDRY transitions onto the second guard and swings his hammer, GUARD 1 turns to look and catches a hammer blow to the face is looking at TYRION and motions towards GENDRY

<name="cersei"> He betrayed you He set up a meeting without your knowledge or consent Do you think anything of importance happens in this city without me knowing?
<name="jaime"> You let it happen Why?
<name="cersei"> Ive come to believe that accomodation with the Dragon Queen could be in our immediate interest She has the numbers If we want to beat her we have to be clever We have to fight her like father would have Dead men, dragons and Dragon Queens, whatever stands in our way we will defeat it ourselves for our house For this CERSEI lifts her hands from the chair and places them both on her stomach indicating shes pregnant looks shocked

<name="jon"> Well, thats a problem
<name="gendry"> I prefer a hammer GENDRY looks t
<name="davos"> He can handle himself nods
<name="jon"> We could use the help
<name="davos"> As my father used to say, its better to be a coward for a minute than dead for the rest of your life
<name="gendry"> I owe you my life Twice over But if what you said is true about whats out there, I cant wait out this war
<name="davos"> Yeah Nobody mind me All Ive ever done is live to a ripe old age Two landing boats are sitting on the beach surrounded by two groups of men A large sailboat is anchored in the bay JORAH places his sword and a case of Dragonglass into the boat walks down the beach and stands next to JORAH
<name="tyrion"> You may not believe it, but Ive missed you Mormont Nobody glowers quite like you Not even Grey Worm retrieves a gold coin from his pocket and turns it in his hands
<name="tyrion"> This is the coin the slaver gave me when I suggested he free us and pay us Remember?
<name="jorah"> It was supposed to last us the rest of our lives smiles and hands the coin to JORAH
<name="tyrion"> Take it with you Youll bring it back Our queen needs you JORAH nods to TYRION appears and walks up to JORAH

<name="sam"> No
<name="gilly"> 15,782 SAM looks up from his work annoyed He remains silent and continues working
<name="gilly"> Guess how many windows are in the Great Sept of Baelor looks away and pauses
<name="sam"> None anymore
<name="gilly"> Thats true This High Septon Meynard, he recorded everything He even recorded his own bowel movements What does annulment mean?
<name="sam"> Its when a man sets asside his lawful wife
<name="gilly"> Meynard says here that he issued an anullment for Prince Rhaegar and remarried him to someone else at the same time in a secret ceremony in Dorne Is that a common thing isnt paying much attention to GILLY He loudly interrupts her
<name="sam"> These maesters, they set me to the task of preserving that mans window counting and anullments and bowel movements for all eternity while the secret to defeating the Night Kings probably sitting on some dusty shelf somewhere completely ignored But thats all right, isnt it We could all become slavering, murderous imbecils enthralled to evil incarnate as long as we can have access to the full records of High Septon Meynards 15,782 shits
<name="gilly"> Steps That number was steps SAMWELL is dismayed He sets his quill down and grabs the book he was writing in and hands it to SAM Jr He retrieves his cloak and walks out the door

Season 7
EPISODE "STORMBORN" - 23/07/2017


<name="tyrion"> On a night like this, you came into the world
<name="varys"> I remember that storm All the dogs in Kings Landing howled through the night
<name="daenerys"> I wish I could remember it
<name="daenerys"> I always thought this would be a homecoming It doesnt feel like home
<name="tyrion"> We wont stay on Dragonstone for long
<name="daenerys"> Good
<name="daenerys"> Not so many lions
<name="varys"> Cersei controls fewer than half the Seven Kingdoms The lord of Westeros despise her Even before your arrival, they plotted against her Now.
<name="daenerys"> They cry out for their true queen? They drink secret toasts to my health?
<name="daenerys"> People used to tell my brother that sort of thing, and he was stupid enough to believe them
<name="daenerys"> If Viserys had three dragons and an army at his back, hed have invaded Kings Landing already
<name="tyrion"> Conquering Westeros would be easy for you But youre not here to be queen of the ashes
<name="daenerys"> No
<name="tyrion"> We can take the Seven Kingdoms without turning it into a slaughterhouse If the great houses support your claim against Cersei, the game is won With the Tyrell army and the Dornish on our side, we have powerful allies in the south
<name="daenerys"> I never properly thanked you for that
<name="varys"> They joined our side, my queen, because they believe in you
<name="daenerys"> You served my father, didnt you, Lord Varys?
<name="varys"> I did
<name="daenerys"> And then you served the man who overthrew him?
<name="varys"> I had a choice, Your Grace serve Robert Baratheon or face the headmans axe
<name="daenerys"> But you didnt serve him long You turned against him
<name="varys"> Robert was an improvement on your father, to be sure There have been few rulers in history as cruel as the Mad King Robert was neither mad nor cruel He simply had no interest in being king
<name="daenerys"> So you took it upon yourself to find a better one
<name="tyrion"> Your Grace, when I was ready to drink myself into a small coffin, Lord Varys told me about a queen in the east who-
<name="daenerys"> Before I came to power, you favored my brother All your spies, your little birds, did they tell you Viserys was cruel, stupid, and weak? Would those qualities have made for a good king in your learned opinion?
<name="varys"> Until your marriage to Khal Drogo, Your Grace, I knew nothing about you, save your existence and that you were said to be beautiful
<name="daenerys"> So you and your friends traded me like a prized horse to the Dothraki
<name="varys"> Which you turned to your advantage
<name="daenerys"> Who gave the order to kill me?
<name="varys"> King Robert
<name="daenerys"> Who hired the assassins?
<name="daenerys"> Who sent word to Essos to murder Daenerys Targaryen?
<name="varys"> Your Grace, I did what had to be done to-
<name="daenerys"> To keep yourself alive
<name="tyrion"> Lord Varys has proven himself a loyal servant
<name="daenerys"> Proven himself loyal? Quite the opposite If he dislikes one monarch, he conspires to crown the next one What king of a servant is that?
<name="varys"> The kind the realm needs Incompetence should not be rewarded with blind loyalty As long as I have my eyes, Ill use them I wasnt born into a great house I came from nothing I was sold as a slave and carved up as an offering When I was a child, I lived in alleys, gutters, abandoned houses You wish to know where my true loyalties lie? Not with any king or queen, but with the people The people who suffer under despots and prosper under just rule The people whose hearts you aim to win If you demand blind allegiance, I respect your wishes Grey Worm can behead me or your dragons can devour me But if you let me live, I will serve you well I will dedicate myself to seeing you on the Iron Throne because I choose you Because I know the people have no better chance than you
<name="daenerys"> Swear this to me, Varys If you ever think Im failing the people, you wont conspire behind my back Youll look me in the eye as you have done today, and youll tell me how Im failing them
<name="varys"> I swear it, my queen
<name="daenerys"> And I swear this if you ever betray me, Ill burn you alive
<name="varys"> I would expect nothing less from the Mother of Dragons
<name="grey worm"> Forgive me, my queen A red priestess from Asshai has come to see you
<name="melisandre"> Queen Daeneys, I was a slave once, bought and sold, scourged and branded It is an honor to meet the Breaker of Chains
<name="daenerys"> The Red Priests helped bring peace to Meereen You are very welcome here What is your name?
<name="melisandre"> I am called Melisandre
<name="varys"> She once served another who wanted the Iron Throne It didnt end well for Stannis Baratheon, did it?
<name="melisandre"> No, it didnt
<name="daenerys"> You chose an auspicious day to arrive at Dragonstone
<name="daenerys"> Weve just decided to pardon those who served the wrong king
<name="daenerys"> The Lord of Light doesnt have many followers in Westeros, does he?
<name="melisdandre"> Not yet But even those who dont worship the Lord can serve his cause
<name="daenerys"> What does your Lord expect from me?
<name="melisandre"> The Long Night is coming Only the prince who was promised can bring the dawn
<name="daenerys"> The prince who was promised will bring the dawn Im afraid Im not a prince
<name="missandei"> Your Grace, forgive me, but your translation is not quite accurate That noun has no gender in High Valyrian, so the proper translation for that prophecy would be the prince or princess who was promised will bring the dawn
<name="tyrion"> Doesnt really roll off the tongue, does it?
<name="daenerys"> No, but I like it better
<name="daenerys"> And you believe this prophecy refers to me?
<name="melisandre"> Prophecies are dangerous things I believe you have a role to play, as does another ing in the North, Jon Snow
<name="tyrion"> Jon Snow? Ned Starks bastard?
<name="daenerys"> You know him?
<name="tyrion"> I traveled with him to the Wall when he joined the Nights Watch
<name="varys"> And why do you think the Lord of Light singled out this Jon Snow aside from the visions youve seen in the flames, that is?
<name="melisandre"> As Lord Commander of the Nights Watch he allowed the Wildlings south of the Wall to protect them from great danger As King in the North he has united those Wildlings with the northern houses so together they may face their common enemy
<name="daenerys"> He sounds like quite a man
<name="melisandre"> Summon Jon Snow Let him stand before you and tell you things that have happened to him, the things that he has seen with his own eyes
<name="tyrion"> I cant speak to prophecies or visions in the flames, but I like Jon Snow and I trusted him, and I am an excellent judge of character
<name="tyrion"> If he does rule the north, he would make a valuable ally The Lannisters executed his father and conspired to murder his brother Jon Snow has even more reason to hate Cersei than you do
<name="daenerys"> Very well Send a raven north Tell Jon Snow that his Queen invites him to come to Drangonstone and bend the knee
<name="sansa"> Do you think its really Tyrion? It could be someone trying to lure you into a trap
<name="jon"> Read the last bit
<name="sansa"> All dwarfs are bastards in their fathers eyes What does that mean?
<name="jon"> Its something he said to me the first night we met You know him better than any of us What do you think?
<name="sansa"> Tyrion is not like the other Lannisters He was always kind to me, but its too great a risk The Seven Kingdoms will bleed as long as Cersei sits on the Iron Throne Join us Together we can end her tyranny
<name="davos"> Sounds like a charmer Of course, the casual mention of a Dothraki horde, a legion of Unsullied and three dragons, a bit less charming
<name="jon"> What?
<name="davos"> Fire kills Whites, you told me What breathes fire?
<name="sansa"> Youre not suggesting Jon meet with her?
<name="davos"> No, too dangerous
<name="jon"> But?
<name="davos"> But if the Army of the Dead makes it passed the Wall, do we have enough men to fight them?
<name="cersei"> If the Mad Kings daughter takes the Iron Throne, she will destroy the Realm as we know it Some of you are bannermen of House Tyrell But House Tyrell is in open rebellion against the Crown With their help the Mad Kings daughter has ferried an army of savages to our shores Mindless Unsullied soldiers who will destroy your castles and your holdfasts Dothraki heathens who will burn your villages to the ground, rape and enslave your women, and butcher your children without a second thought This is how Olenna Tyrell rewards centuries of service and loyalty
<name="cersei"> You all remember the Mad King You remember the horrors he inflicted upon his people His daughter is no different In Essos her brutality is already legendary She crucified hundreds of noblemen in Slavers Bay And when she grew bored of that, she fed them to her dragons
<name="cersei"> It is my solemn duty to protect the people, and I will but I need your help, My Lords We must stand together, all of us, if we hope to stop her
<name="randyll"> She has three full-grown dragons, Your Grace The same as Aegon when he conquered the Seven Kingdoms How do you propose to stop them?
<name="qyburn"> We are currently at work on a solution, My Lord
<name="jaime"> Lord Tarley
<name="randyll"> Ser, Jaime I believe you know my son
<name="dickon"> Ser, Jaime
<name="jaime"> Rickon, isnt it?
<name="dickon"> Dickon
<name="jaime"> Thats it
<name="jaime"> Thank you for coming The other lords of the Reach look to you for guidance now more than ever They might not have come if you hadnt
<name="randyll"> If my queen summons me, I answer the call And Ive heard what she does to those that defy her
<name="jaime"> Do you ride for Hornhill today?
<name="randyll"> I have an army to mobilize It wont be long until the fighting starts
<name="jaime"> And what side will you be fighting for? You were the only man to defeat Robert Baratheon in battle Not even Rhaegar Targaryen could -
<name="randyll"> Its a long ride back to the reach, Ser Jaime How may I serve?
<name="jaime"> I want you to be my ranking general in the wars to come I want you to swear allegiance to Cersei and I want you to help her destroy her enemies All of her enemies
<name="randyll"> Including Olenna Tyrell? Im a Tarley That name means something Were not oath breakers Were not schemers We dont stab our rivals in the back or cut their throats at weddings I swore an oath to House Tyrell
<name="jaime"> You swore an oath to the Crown as well, Lord Tarley
<name="randyll"> Ive known Olenna since I was a child
<name="jaime"> She was a great woman, once Now shes broken She wants revenge so badly she brought the Dothraki to our shores The Dothraki in Westeros for the first time in history I know you dont like my sister, but you have to make a choice Do you fight with us or with the foreign savages and eunuchs?
<name="jaime"> When the war is won the queen will need a new warden of the south I can think of no better man than Randyll Tarley
<name="cut to"> CITADEL
<name="quarantine rooms marwyn"> The infection has spread too far You should have cut off your arm the moment you were touched
<name="jorah"> How long?
<name="marwyn"> It will be years before it kills you It could be 10, could be 20
<name="jorah"> But how long till.
<name="marwyn"> Your mind? Six months, maybe fewer
<name="sam"> Pardon, Archmaester I met Stannis Baratheons daughter at Castle Black She had Greyscale as a baby and was cured Isnt there some way -
<name="marwyn"> Does this look like a baby to you?
<name="sam"> No
<name="marwyn"> Have you studied the varying rates of Greyscale progression in infants and fully grown men?
<name="sam"> No
<name="marwyn"> Maester Chrissen discovered Shireen Baratheons affliction immediately
<name="marwyn"> This is quite advanced and beyond our skills, Ser Were you a commoner Id have you shipped to Valyria at once to live out your life with the Stone Men As an anointed Knight Ill allow you one more day How you choose to spend that time is up to you
<name="marwyn"> Come, Samwell
<name="sam"> Should we send word to your family, Ser.
<name="jorah"> Jorah Jorah Mormont
<name="sam"> Mormont?
<name="jorah"> Theres no need Ive been dead to them for years
<name="marwyn"> Come, Samwell
<name="cut to"> UNDER THE RED KEEP
<name="dungeons qyburn"> Have you ever been down here, Your Grace?
<name="cersei"> No, I cant say I have I havent seen these since Robert had them removed from the Throne Room
<name="qyburn"> Curious that King Robert did not have them destroyed
<name="cersei"> They were his trophies He couldnt keep them around They would have made him look small Sometimes he would come down here and look at them I believe he brought his whores on occasion
<name="qyburn"> Balerion the Dread The beast that Aegon rode across the sea Its flames forged the Iron Throne and brought the Seven Kingdoms to heel Powerful, but not invincible
<name="qyburn"> Apparently one of Daenarys dragons was wounded by spears in the fighting pits of Meereen If they can be wounded, they can be killed
<name="qyburn"> The finest artilleters and blacksmiths in Kings Landing have been laboring day and night, Your Grace If youd kindly pull that lever
<name="yara"> If you want the Iron Throne, take it We have an army, a fleet, and three dragons We should hit Kings Landing now Hard With everything we have The city will fall within a day
<name="tyrion"> If we turn the dragons loose, tens of thousands will die in the firestorms
<name="ellaria"> Its called war You dont have the stomach for it, scurry back into hiding
<name="tyrion"> I know how you wage war We dont poison little girls here Myrcella was innocent
<name="ellaria"> She was a Lannister There are no innocent Lannisters My greatest regret is that Oberyn died fighting for you
<name="daenerys"> Thats enough Tyrion is the Hand of the Queen You will treat him with respect
<name="daenerys"> I am not here to be queen of the ashes
<name="olenna"> Thats very nice to hear Of course, I cant remember a queen who was better loved than my grand daughter The common people loved her, the nobles loved her And what is left of her now? Ashes Commoners, nobles, theyre all just children really They wont obey you unless they fear you
<name="daenerys"> Im grateful to you, Lady Olenna, for your council Im grateful to all of you But you have chosen to follow me I will not attack Kings Landing We will not attack Kings Landing
<name="oleanna"> Then how do you mean to take the Iron Throne? By asking nicely?
<name="daenerys"> We will lay siege to the capital surrounding the city on all sides Cersei will have the Iron Throne but no food for her army or the people
<name="tyrion"> But we wont use Dothraki and Unsullied
<name="tyrion"> Cersei will try to rally the lords of Westeros by appealing to their loyalty, their love for their country If we besiege the city with foreigners, we prove her point Our army should be Westerosi
<name="ellia"> And I suppose were providing the Westerosi?
<name="tyrion"> You are
<name="tyrion"> Lady Greyjoy will escort you home to Sunspear and her Iron Fleet will ferry the Dornish army back up to Kings Landing
<name="tyrion"> The Dornish will lay siege to the capital alongside the Tyrell army Two great kingdoms united against Cersei
<name="olenna"> So, your master plan is to use our armies? Forgive me for asking, but why did you bother to bring your own?
<name="tyrion"> The unsullied will have another objective For decades House Lannister has been the true power in Westeros And the seat of that power is Casterly Rock Grey Worm and the Unsullied will sail for the Rock and take it
<name="daenerys"> Do I have your support?
<name="yara"> You have mine
<name="ellia"> Dorne is with you, Your Grace
<name="daenerys"> Thank you all Lady Olenna, may I speak with you alone?
<name="daenerys"> I realize youre here out of hatred for Cersei and not love for me But I swear to you she will pay for what shes done and we will bring peace back to Westeros
<name="olenna"> Peace Do you think thats what we had under your father or his father or his? Peace never lasts, my dear Would you take a bit of advice from an old woman?
<name="olenna"> Hes a clever man, your Hand Ive known a great many clever men Ive outlived them all Do you know why? I ignored them The lords of Westeros are sheep Are you a sheep? No Youre a dragon Be a dragon
<name="grey worm"> Enter
<name="missandei"> You leave tomorrow Were you going to say goodbye?
<name="grey worm"> I will see you when I return
<name="missandei"> But you dont know when that will be
<name="greyworm"> No one knows
<name="missandei"> I wish you good fortune
<name="grey worm"> Missandei -
<name="grey worm"> It is hard for me to say goodbye to you
<name="missandei"> Why?
<name="grey worm"> You know why
<name="missandei"> I dont
<name="grey worm"> You are my weakness
<name="missandei"> Thats what I am? Your weakness?
<name="grey worm"> When Unsullied are young their masters learn their fears One boy is scared of dogs One boy hates high places One is frightened of the ocean They make the boy sleep with dogs or climb a cliff They throw him in the water If he learns to swim, good If he drowns, good Either way, strong Unsullied But I had no fears I was never the biggest, never the strongest, but I was bravest always
<name="missandei"> I believe it
<name="grey worm"> Until I meet Missandei from the Isle of Naarth Now I have fear
<name="missandei"> I do too
<name="grey worm"> No
<name="missandei"> I want to see you Please
<name="marwyn"> It might be useful Fouthen was a dreadful writer but an excellent researcher
<name="sam"> Archmaester, I wanted to -
<name="marwyn"> And this one
<name="marwyn"> Maester Faol was quite the opposite A brilliant stylist who invented half the stories he tells
<name="sam"> I wanted to ask you -
<name="marwyn"> If you need to write histories, Tarley, you have to do the research If you want people to read your histories, you need a bit of style Im not writing the Chronicle of the Wars Following the Death of King Robert the First so it can sit on a shelf unread
<name="marwyn"> What? You dont like the title? What would you call it then?
<name="sam"> Possibly something a bit more poetic?
<name="marwyn"> Were not poets, Tarley
<name="sam"> Archmaester, if I could just have a moment
<name="marwyn"> This is your moment Use it wisely
<name="sam"> I may have found a way to treat Ser Jorah There are two recorded cases of advanced Greyscale being cured I found the procedure in the Study of Rare Diseases by Archmaester Pilos
<name="marwyn"> Im familiar with Archmaester Pylos and the Study of Rare Diseases
<name="sam"> Oh, you are?
<name="marwyn"> Yes Should I tell you how he died? From Greyscale
<name="sam"> Oh
<name="marwyn"> The procedure is far too dangerous which is why its now forbidden

<name="kings quarters jon"> Come in
<name="wolkan"> A raven, My King, from the Citadel
<name="great hall jon"> This message was sent to me by Samwell Tarley He was my brother at the Nights Watch A man I trust as much as anyone in this world Hes discovered proof that Dragonstone sits on a mountain of Dragonglass
<name="jon"> I received this a few days ago from Dragonstone It was sent to me by Tyrion Lannister
<name="jon"> Hes now Hand of the Queen to Daenerys Targaryen She intends to take the Iron Throne from Cersei Lannister She has a powerful army at her back and if this message is to be believed, three dragons
<name="jon"> Lord Tyrion has invited me to Dragonstone to meet with Daenerys and Im going to accept
<name="jon"> We need this Dragonglass, My Lords We know that Dragonglass can destroy both White Walkers and their army We need to mine it and turn it into weapons
<name="jon"> But more importantly, we need allies The Night Kings army grows larger by the day We cant defeat them on our own We dont have the numbers Daenerys has her own army and she has dragon fire I need to try and persuade her to fight with us Ser Davos and I will ride for White Harbor tomorrow, then sail for Dragonstone
<name="sansa"> Have you forgotten what happened to our grandfather? The Mad King invited him to Kings Landing and roasted him alive
<name="jon"> I know that
<name="sansa"> She is here to reclaim the Iron Throne and the Seven Kingdoms The north is one of those seven kingdoms This isnt an invitation, its a trap
<name="jon"> It could be, but I dont believe Tyrion would do that You know him Hes a good man
<name="yohn royce"> Your Grace, with respect I must agree with Lady Sansa I remember the Mad King all too well A Targaryen cannot be trusted, nor can a Lannister
<name="robett glover"> W calle you brothe king an the h rod sout an los hi kingdom
<name="nan"> Winter is here, Your Grace We need the King in the North in the north
<name="jon"> You all crowned me your king I never wanted it, I never asked for it, but I accepted it because the north is my home Its part of me and I will never stop fighting for it, no matter the odds But the odds are against us None of you have seen the Army of the Dead None of you We can never hope to defeat them alone We need allies, powerful allies I know its a risk But I have to take it
<name="sansa"> Then send an emissary Dont go yourself
<name="jon"> Daenerys is a queen Only a king can convince her to help us It has to be me
<name="sansa"> Youre abandoning your people Your abandoning your home
<name="jon"> Im leaving both in good hands
<name="sansa"> Whose?
<name="jon"> Yours You are my sister You are the only Stark in Winterfell Until I return, the north is yours
<name="littlefinger"> I delivered his bones myself I presented them to Lady Catlyn as a gesture of goodwill from Tyrion Lannister It seems like a lifetime ago Do give Lord Tyrion my best when you see him
<name="littlefinger"> I was sorry when he died Your father and I had our differences but he loved Cat very much So did I She wasnt fond of you, was she? Well, it appears she vastly underestimated you Your father and brothers are gone, yet here you stand King in the North Last best hope against the coming storm
<name="jon"> You dont belong down here
<name="littlefinger"> Forgive me We have never talked properly I wanted to remedy that
<name="jon"> I have nothing to say to you
<name="littlefinger"> Not even thank you? If it werent for me youd have been slaughtered at that battlefield You have many enemies, My King, but I swear to you Im not one of them I love Sansa as I loved her mother
<name="jon"> Touch my sister and Ill kill you myself

<name="bronn"> Oil?
<name="soldier"> Pitch, my lord
<name="bronn"> How many barrels?
<name="soldier"> 500, my lord
<name="bronn"> Get 500 more
<name="soldier"> Yes, my lord
<name="bronn"> I still enjoy it when they call me my lord
<name="jaime"> The thrill will fade
<name="bronn"> If we live that long Men without cocks You wouldnt find me fighting in an army if I had no cock Whats left to fight for?
<name="jaime"> Gold?
<name="bronn"> I spent my life around soldiers What do you think they spend that gold on?
<name="jaime"> Family
<name="bronn"> Not without a cock, you dont
<name="jaime"> Maybe it really is all cocks in the end
<name="bronn"> Yet, your brother-
<name="jaime"> Yes, hes always been a champion of the downtrodden
<name="bronn"> I think were about to be the downtrodden
<name="man"> Archers, stand tall
<name="man"> Cover that wall
<name="jon"> How many people live here?
<name="tyrion"> A million, give or take
<name="jon"> Thats more people than the entire North crammed into that Why would anyone want to live that way?
<name="tyrion"> Theres more work in the city And the brothels are far superior
<name="cersei"> Why isnt she with them?
<name="qyburn"> Im afraid I dont know, Your Grace No one has seen her
<name="cersei"> And the rest of them?
<name="qyburn"> Theyre on their way to the dragon pit now
<name="cersei"> Including our brother
<name="qyburn"> Yes, Your Grace
<name="cersei"> If anything goes wrong, kill the silver-haired bitch first, then our brother, then the bastard who calls himself king
<name="missandei"> Why did they build it?
<name="jorah"> Dragons dont understand the difference between what is theirs and what isnt Land, livestock, children Letting them roam free around a city was a problem
<name="tyrion"> I imagine it was a sad joke at the end An entire arena for a few sickly creatures smaller than dogs But in the beginning, when it was home to Balerion the Dread, it must have been the most dangerous place in the world
<name="davos"> Maybe it still is
<name="bronn"> Welcome, my lords Your friends arrived before you did
<name="bronn"> Ive been sent to escort you all to the meeting
<name="tyrion"> A pleasant surprise in an unpleasant situation
<name="podrick"> I never thought Id see you again, my lord
<name="tyrion"> Supporting the enemy, no less
<name="podrick"> Hard to blame you
<name="tyrion"> Cersei will anyway
<name="podrick"> Im glad youre alive
<name="bronn"> Come on! You can suck his magic cock later
<name="soldier"> Whats in there?
<name="sandor"> Fuck off
<name="brienne"> I thought you were dead
<name="sandor"> Not yet You came pretty close
<name="brienne"> I was only trying to protect her
<name="sandor"> You and me both
<name="brienne"> Shes alive Arya
<name="sandor"> Where?
<name="brienne"> Winterfell
<name="sandor"> Whos protecting her if youre here?
<name="brienne"> The only one that needs protecting is the one that gets in her way
<name="sandor"> It wont be me
<name="tyrion"> Here we are the heroes of Blackwater Bay Strange place for a reunion
<name="podrick"> It is, my lord
<name="tyrion"> I dont think Im anyones lord anymore, Podrick Save the titles for Ser Bronn of the Blackwater
<name="bronn"> Im sure your new queen-
<name="tyrion"> Youve been thinking about our new queen
<name="varys"> And that would be double what now, exactly?
<name="bronn"> Dont you worry about me Im doing all right Looking after myself
<name="tyrion"> Are you? Helping me to arrange this meeting wasnt exactly looking after yourself, was it? You put yourself at risk
<name="bronn"> I put yourself at risk Important difference Its your head Queen Cerseis offered a bag of gold for, its not mine Now, thanks to me, shes got two traitors heads coming right through her door She can lop them both off as soon as she gets tired of the clever words that pour out their pieholes All thanks to Ser Bronn of the fucking Blackwater If thats not looking after myself, I dont know what is
<name="tyrion"> Its good to see you again
<name="bronn"> Yeah, you, too
<name="sandor"> Anyone touches it, Ill kill you first
<name="bronn"> Come on, Pod Lets you and me go have a drink while the fancy folks talk, eh?
<name="sandor"> I left this shit city because I didnt want to die in it Am I going to die in this shit city?
<name="tyrion"> You might
<name="sandor"> And this is all your idea Seems every bad idea has some Lannister cunt behind it
<name="tyrion"> And some Clegane cunt to help them see it through
<name="sandor"> Remember me? Yeah, you do Youre even fucking uglier than I am now What did they do to you? Doesnt matter Thats not how it ends for you, brother
<name="cersei"> Where is she?
<name="tyrion"> Shell be here soon
<name="cersei"> Didnt travel with you?
<name="tyrion"> No
<name="cersei"> Weve been here for some time
<name="daenerys"> My apologies
<name="tyrion"> We are all facing a unique
<name="euron"> Theon! I have your sister
<name="tyrion"> I think we ought to begin with larger concerns
<name="euron"> Then why are you talking? Youre the smallest concern here
<name="tyrion"> Do you remember when we discussed dwarf jokes? His wasnt even good He explained it at the end Never explain It always ruins it
<name="euron"> We dont even let your kind live in the Iron Islands, you know? We kill you at birth An act of mercy for the parents
<name="jaime"> Perhaps you ought to sit down
<name="euron"> Why?
<name="cersei"> Sit down or leave
<name="tyrion"> We are a group of people who do not like one another, as this recent demonstration has shown We have suffered at each others hands We have lost people we love at each others hands If all we wanted was more of the same, there would be no need for this gathering We are entirely capable of waging war against each other without meeting face-to-face
<name="cersei"> So instead, we should settle our differences and live together in harmony for the rest of our days?
<name="tyrion"> We all know that will never happen
<name="cersei"> Then why are we here?
<name="jon"> This isnt about living in harmony Its just about living The same thing is coming for all of us A general you cant negotiate with An army that doesnt leave corpses behind on the battlefield Lord Tyrion tells me a million people live in this city Theyre about to become a million more soldiers in the Army of the Dead
<name="cersei"> I imagine for most of them it would be an improvement
<name="jon"> This is serious I wouldnt be here if it werent
<name="cersei"> I dont think its serious at all I think its another bad joke If my brother Jaime has informed me correctly, youre asking me for a truce
<name="daenerys"> Yes Thats all
<name="cersei"> Thats all? Pull back my armies and stand down while you go on your monster hunt Or while you solidify and expand your position Hard for me to know which it is with my armies pulled back until you return and march on my capital with four times the men
<name="daenerys"> Your capital will be safe until the northern threat is dealt with You have my word
<name="cersei"> The word of a would-be usurper
<name="tyrion"> There is no conversation that will erase the last 50 years We have something to show you
<name="jon"> We can destroy them by burning them
<name="jon"> And we can destroy them with dragonglass If we dont win this fight, then that is the fate of every person in the world
<name="jon"> There is only one war that matters the Great War And it is here
<name="daenerys"> I didnt believe it until I saw them I saw them all
<name="jaime"> How many?
<name="daenerys"> A hundred thousand, at least
<name="euron"> Can they swim?
<name="jon"> No
<name="euron"> Good Im taking the Iron Fleet back to the Iron Islands
<name="cersei"> What are you talking about?
<name="euron"> Ive been around the world Ive seen everything, things you couldnt imagine, and this this is the only thing Ive ever seen that terrifies me
<name="euron"> Im going back to my island You should go back to yours When winters over, well be the only ones left alive
<name="cersei"> Hes right to be afraid And a coward to run If those things come for us, there will be no kingdoms to rule Everything we suffered will have been for nothing Everything we lost will have been for nothing The crown accepts your truce Until the dead are defeated, they are the true enemy
<name="cersei"> In return
<name="daenerys"> Just the King
<name="cersei"> I would never ask it of you You would never agree to it And if you did, I would trust you even less than I do now I ask it only of Ned Starks son I know Ned Starks son
<name="jon"> I am true to my word Or I try to be That is why I cannot give you what you ask I cannot serve two queens And I have already pledged myself to Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen
<name="cersei"> Then there is nothing left to discuss The dead will come north first Enjoy dealing with them We will deal with whatever is left of you
<name="brienne"> Ser Jaime
<name="jaime"> Its been good to see you I imagine the next time will be across a battlefield
<name="brienne"> We both saw what just happened We both saw that thing
<name="jaime"> Yes, and Im not looking forward to seeing more of them But Im loyal to the queen and youre loyal to Sansa and her dolt brother
<name="brienne"> Oh, fuck loyalty
<name="jaime"> Fuck loyalty?
<name="brienne"> This goes beyond houses and honor and oaths Talk to the queen
<name="jaime"> And tell her what?
<name="davos"> I wish you hadnt done that
<name="daenerys"> Im grateful for your loyalty, but my dragon died so that we could be here If its all for nothing, then he died for nothing
<name="jon"> I know
<name="tyrion"> Im pleased you bent the knee to our queen
<name="jon"> Im not going to swear an oath I cant uphold Talk about my father
<name="tyrion"> That is indeed a problem The more immediate problem is that were fucked
<name="davos"> Any ideas as to how we might change that state of affairs?
<name="tyrion"> Only one Everyone stays here, and I go and talk to my sister
<name="daenerys"> I didnt come all this way to have my Hand
<name="tyrion"> I dont want Cersei to murder me either I could have stayed in my cell and saved a great deal of trouble
<name="jon"> I did this I should go
<name="tyrion"> Shell definitely murder you I go see my sister
<name="tyrion"> You spoke with her?
<name="jaime"> At her until she kicked me out She thinks I was an idiot to trust you A lot of people seem to think that, actually
<name="tyrion"> Im about to step into a room with the most murderous woman in the world whos already tried to kill me twice, that I know of Whos an idiot?
<name="jaime"> I suppose we should say goodbye, one idiot to another
<name="cersei"> I shouldnt be surprised, I suppose Shes your kind of woman a foreign whore who doesnt know her place
<name="tyrion"> A foreign whore you cant abduct, beat, or intimidate That must be difficult for you
<name="cersei"> So you bring her here with her pet Northerner, whom youve convinced to bow down before her
<name="tyrion"> I didnt know about that
<name="cersei"> And now youve got them both working towards the same goal, the goal youve worked towards your entire life
<name="tyrion"> Cersei, I didnt know
<name="cersei"> the destruction of this family
<name="tyrion"> I am the one preventing that from happening Daenerys didnt want to debate and negotiate She didnt want to bring you words She wanted to bring you fire and blood until I advised her otherwise I dont want to destroy our family I never have
<name="cersei"> You killed our father
<name="tyrion"> After he sentenced me to death for a crime I didnt commit, yes, I killed him Hate me for it if you want I hate myself for it in spite of what he was, in spite of what he did to me
<name="cersei"> Oh, poor little man Your papa was mean to you Do you have any idea what you did when you fired that crossbow? You left us open You laid us bare for the vultures, and the vultures came and tore us apart You may not have killed Joffrey, but you killed Myrcella, you killed Tommen No one wouldve touched them if Father-
<name="tyrion"> I have never been more sorry about anything
<name="cersei"> I will not hear it, not from you
<name="cersei"> I will not hear it
<name="tyrion"> All right You love your family, and I have destroyed it I will always be a threat So put an end to me
<name="tyrion"> If it werent for me, youd have a motherIf it werent for me, youd have a father
<name="tyrion"> I am more sorry about the children than you could ever know
<name="cersei"> I will not
<name="tyrion"> I dont care I loved them You know I did You know it in your heart if theres anything left of it
<name="cersei"> It doesnt matter Your love doesnt matter Your feelings dont matter I dont care why you did what you did I only care what it cost us It cost us our future
<name="tyrion"> If theres no future, then why are we here? Why did you allow me to come?
<name="cersei"> Not to help my enemies collaborate in my destruction
<name="tyrion"> Yes, no, not what you hoped for, but you must have hoped for something
<name="cersei"> What did you hope for? To make Jon Snow submit to your queen
<name="tyrion"> Mm, not like this
<name="cersei"> But eventually, you want everyone to bend the knee to her
<name="tyrion"> Yes
<name="cersei"> Why?
<name="tyrion"> Because I think she will make the world a better place
<name="cersei"> You said shed destroy Kings Landing
<name="tyrion"> She knows herself She chose an advisor who would check her worst impulses instead of feeding them
<name="cersei"> Thats the difference between you I dont care about checking my worst impulses I dont care about making the world a better place Hang the world
<name="cersei"> That thing you dragged here, I know what it is, I know what it means And when it came at me, I didnt think about the world Not at all As soon as it opened its mouth, the world disappeared for me, right down its black throat All I could think about was keeping those gnashing teeth away from the ones who matter most, away from my family Maybe Euron Greyjoy had the right idea Get on a boat, take those who matter
<name="tyrion"> Youre pregnant
<name="jon"> No one is less happy about this than I am
<name="daenerys"> I know I respect what you did Wish you hadnt done it, but I respect it
<name="daenerys"> This place was the beginning of the end for my family A dragon is not a slave They were terrifying Extraordinary They filled people with wonder and awe, and we locked them in here They wasted away They grew small And we grew small as well We werent extraordinary without them We were just like everyone else
<name="jon"> Youre not like everyone else And your family hasnt seen its end Youre still here
<name="daenerys"> I cant have children
<name="jon"> Who told you that?
<name="daenerys"> The witch who murdered my husband
<name="jon"> Has it occurred to you she might not have been a reliable source of information?
<name="daenerys"> You were right from the beginning If I had trusted you, everything would be different
<name="jon"> So, what now?
<name="daenerys"> I cant forget what I saw north of the Wall And I cant pretend that Cersei wont take back half the country the moment I march north
<name="jon"> It appears Tyrions assessment was correct Were fucked
<name="cersei"> My armies will not stand down I will not pull them back to the capital I will march them north to fight alongside you in the Great War The darkness is coming for us all Well face it together And when the Great War is over, perhaps youll remember I chose to help with no promises or assurances from any of you I expect not Call our banners All of them
<name="littlefinger"> Its not easy for ravens to fly in these storms Perhaps Jon tried to send word earlier
<name="sansa"> No, this is the way he is, the way hes always been He never asked for my opinion Why would he start now?
<name="littlefinger"> I cant believe hed surrender the Northern crown without consulting you
<name="sansa"> This is his writing, his signature He pledged to fight for Daenerys Targaryen Hes bent the knee
<name="littlefinger"> Ive heard gossip that the Dragon Queen is quite beautiful
<name="sansa"> What does that have to do with anything?
<name="littlefinger"> Jon is young and unmarried Daenerys is young and unmarried
<name="sansa"> You think he wants to marry her?
<name="littlefinger"> An alliance makes sense Together, theyd be difficult to defeat He was named King
<name="sansa"> Even if I wanted to, Arya would never go along She always loved Jon far more than she ever loved me, and shed kill anyone who betrayed her family
<name="littlefinger"> You are family, too Would Arya really murder her own sister?
<name="sansa"> Do you know what she is now? Do you know what the Faceless Men are?
<name="littlefinger"> Only by reputation They worship the God of Death, I believe I never trust godly men
<name="sansa"> Theyre killers And Arya was one of them What do you think shes after?
<name="littlefinger"> Shes your sister
<name="sansa"> She could want me dead because she thinks I wronged my family
<name="littlefinger"> Why did she come to Winterfell?
<name="sansa"> To kill me for marrying our enemies and betraying my family
<name="littlefinger"> Why did she unearth the letter Cersei made you write?
<name="sansa"> To provide proof of my betrayals To provide justification after she murders me
<name="littlefinger"> And after she murders you, what does she become?
<name="lady jon"> If we have the Dothraki ride hard on the kingsroad, theyll arrive at Winterfell within the fortnight
<name="daenerys"> And the Unsullied? We can sail with them to White Harbor, meet the Dothraki here on the kingsroad, then ride together to Winterfell
<name="jorah"> Perhaps you should fly to Winterfell, Your Grace You have many enemies in the North Thousands fell fighting your fatherAll it takes is one angry man with a crossbow Hell see your silver hair on the kingsroad and know that one well-placed bolt will make him a hero The man who killed the conqueror
<name="jon"> Its your decision, Your Grace But if were going to be allies in this war, its important for the Northerners to see us as allies If we sail to White Harbor together, I think it sends a better message
<name="daenerys"> Ive not come to conquer the North Im coming to save the North We sail together
<name="theon"> Jon
<name="theon"> Can I speak with you?
<name="jon"> All right
<name="theon"> What you did in Kings Landing, what you said You couldve lied to Cersei about bending the knee to Daenerys You risked everything to tell an enemy the truth
<name="jon"> We went down there to make peace And it seems to me we need to be honest with each other if were going to fight together
<name="theon"> Youve always known what was right Even when we were all young and stupid, you always knew Every step you take its always the right step
<name="jon"> Its not It may seem that way from the outside, but I promise you, its not true Ive done plenty of things that I regret
<name="theon"> Not compared to me, you havent
<name="jon"> No Not compared to you
<name="theon"> I always wanted to do the right thing Be the right kind of person But I never knew what that meant It always seemed like theres like there was an impossible choice I had to make Stark or Greyjoy
<name="jon"> Our father was more of a father
<name="theon"> He was
<name="jon"> And you betrayed him Betrayed his memory
<name="theon"> I did
<name="jon"> But you never lost him Hes a part of you Just like hes a part of me
<name="theon"> But the things Ive done
<name="jon"> Its not my place to forgive you for all of it But what I can forgive, I do You dont need to choose Youre a Greyjoy and youre a Stark
<name="theon"> When I was Ramsays prisoner, Yara tried to save me Shes the only one who tried to save me She needs me now
<name="jon"> So, why are you still talking to me?
<name="harrag"> Load up Load up, lads Go on Tides coming in
<name="theon"> All of us chose to follow Yara We left the Iron Islands for Yara She would never leave one of us behind Were not leaving her behind
<name="harrag"> Your sister-
<name="theon"> Shes not dead
<name="harrag"> Shes dead Even if Euron hasnt cut her throat yet, shes dead
<name="theon"> Shes our queen
<name="harrag"> Shes your sister
<name="theon"> I did I ran from my uncle
<name="harrag"> So, why in fucks name should we listen to you? They say the dead cant swim Were going to sail east, find a nice, quiet island, kill all the men, and take their wives for ourselves
<name="theon"> Were done with all that
<name="harrag"> Who says we are?
<name="theon"> Yara did She made a pledge Were going to find her, and were going to set her free
<name="harrag"> Run away, little Theon Its what you do best
<name="man"> He needs to shut his mouth
<name="man"> Hey
<name="man"> Oh, yes
<name="man"> Thats more like it
<name="harrag"> Stay down or Ill kill you
<name="harrag"> I said stay down or Ill kill you
<name="theon"> Not for me For Yara
<name="men"> Yara
<name="sansa"> Have my sister
<name="arya"> Are you sure you want to do this?
<name="sansa"> Its not what I want Its what honor demands
<name="arya"> And what does honor demand?
<name="sansa"> That I defend my family from those who would harm us That I defend the North from those who would betray us
<name="arya"> All right, then Get on with it
<name="sansa"> You stand accused of murder You stand accused of treason How do you answer these charges Lord Baelish?
<name="arya"> My sister
<name="littlefinger"> Lady Sansa, forgive me Im a bit confused
<name="sansa"> Which charges confuse you? Lets start with the simplest one you murdered our aunt, Lysa Arryn You pushed her through the Moon Door and watched her fall Do you deny it?
<name="littlefinger"> I did it to protect you
<name="sansa"> You did it to take power in the Vale Earlier, you conspired to murder Jon
<name="littlefinger"> Whatever your aunt
<name="sansa"> You had Aunt Lysa send a letter to our parents telling them it was the Lannisters who murdered Jon
<name="littlefinger"> I know of no such letter
<name="sansa"> You conspired with Cersei Lannister and Joffrey Baratheon to betray our father
<name="littlefinger"> I deny it! None of you were there to see what happened None of you knows the truth
<name="bran"> You held a knife to his throat
<name="bran"> You said, I did warn you not the trust me
<name="arya"> You told our mother
<name="littlefinger"> Lady Sansa, I have known you since you were a girl Ive protected you
<name="sansa"> Protected me? By selling me to the Boltons?
<name="littlefinger"> If we could speak alone, I can explain everything
<name="sansa"> Sometimes when Im trying to understand a persons motives, I play a little game I assume the worst Whats the worst reason you have for turning me against my sisterThats what you do, isnt it? Thats what youve always done turn family against family, turn sister against sister Thats what you did to our mother
<name="littlefinger"> Sansa, please
<name="sansa"> Im a slow learner, its true But I learn
<name="littlefinger"> Give me a chance to defend myself I deserve that
<name="littlefinger"> I am Lord Protector of the Vale and I command you to escort me safely back to the Eyrie
<name="john royce"> I think not
<name="littlefinger"> Sansa, I beg you! I loved your mother since the time I was a boy
<name="sansa"> And yet, you betrayed her
<name="littlefinger"> I loved you More than anyone
<name="sansa"> And yet, you betrayed me
<name="sansa"> When you brought me back to Winterfell, you told me theres no justice in the world, not unless we make it Thank you for all your many lessons, Lord Baelish I will never forget them
<name="littlefinger"> Sansa! I-
<name="jaime"> Our men in Kings Landing will march north in three days time
<name="man"> Itll take us a fortnight just to gather supplies for the train
<name="jaime"> We dont have a fortnight If the North falls, we fall Three days The remaining forces in the Westerlands will take the river road east Well meet at Lord Harroways Town and march together to Winterfell
<name="cersei"> Ser Jaime
<name="jaime"> Your Grace
<name="cersei"> My lords, I need a moment with my brother
<name="men"> Your Grace
<name="cersei"> What are you doing?
<name="jaime"> Preparing the expedition north
<name="cersei"> Expedition north? I always knew you were the stupidest Lannister The Starks and Targaryens have united against us, and you want to fight alongside them? Are you a traitor or an idiot?
<name="jaime"> You pledged our forces to fight our common enemy
<name="cersei"> Ill say whatever I need to say to ensure the survival of our house You expect me to trust the man who murdered our father
<name="jaime"> You saw it with your own eyes You saw a dead man trying to kill us
<name="cersei"> I saw it burn If dragons cant stop them, if Dothraki and Unsullied and Northmen cant stop them, how will our armies make a difference?
<name="jaime"> This isnt about noble houses, this is about the living and the dead
<name="cersei"> And I intend to stay amongst the living Let the Stark boy and his new queen-
<name="jaime"> I made a promise
<name="cersei"> Our child will rule Westeros
<name="jaime"> Our child will never be born if the dead come south
<name="cersei"> The monsters are real The white walkers, the dragons, the Dothraki screamers all the frightening stories we heard when we were young, theyre all real So be it Let the monsters kill each other And while they battle in the North, we take back the lands that belong to us
<name="jaime"> And then what?
<name="cersei"> And then we rule
<name="jaime"> When the fighting in the North is over, someone wins You understand that, dont you? If the dead win, they march south and kill us all If the living win, and weve betrayed them, they march south and kill us all
<name="cersei"> The Targaryens and the Starks already want to kill us all Most of them will die in the North
<name="jaime"> I faced them in the field We cant beat them We cant beat their dragons
<name="cersei"> How many dragons did you see at the pit?
<name="jaime"> Two
<name="cersei"> What happened to the third?
<name="jaime"> For all we know, its guarding her fleet
<name="cersei"> She came here with her dragons and her Dothraki and her Unsullied She came here to show us all her power No, something happened.The dragons are vulnerable
<name="jaime"> We cant beat the Dothraki We dont have the numbers We dont have the support of the other houses
<name="cersei"> No, we have something better We have the Iron Bank You shouldve listened more when Father-
<name="jaime"> The Golden Company is not here Theyre in Essos How is a mercenary company in Essos going to help us?
<name="cersei"> Do you really think Euron Greyjoy turned tail and sailed back to the Iron Islands? Do you think he abandoned the chance to marry the queen?
<name="jaime"> You plotted with Euron Greyjoy without telling me, the commander
<name="cersei"> And you conspired with Tyrion, the man who murdered our father without telling me, your queen
<name="jaime"> I didnt conspire with him
<name="cersei"> You met with him in secret without my consent You planned to promote my enemies interests That is the definition of conspiracy
<name="jaime"> I pledged to ride north I intend to honor that pledge
<name="cersei"> And that will be treason
<name="jaime"> Treason?
<name="cersei"> Disobeying your queen
<name="jaime"> Doesnt matter what Id call it
<name="cersei"> I told you no one walks away from me
<name="jaime"> Are you going to order him to kill me? Im the only one you have left Our children are gone
<name="cersei"> Theres one more yet to come
<name="jaime"> Give the order, then
<name="jaime"> I dont believe you
<name="bran"> Come in
<name="bran"> Samwell Tarly
<name="sam"> I wasnt sure if youd remember me
<name="bran"> I remember everything
<name="bran"> You helped us get beyond the Wall Youre a good man
<name="sam"> Oh, well, thank you, but, um, Im not sure that I am What happened to you beyond the Wall?
<name="bran"> I became the Three-Eyed Raven
<name="sam"> Oh! I dont know what that means
<name="bran"> I can see things that happened in the past I can see things happening now all over the world Why did you come to Winterfell?
<name="sam"> Um, Jons the one to lead the fight against the dead I know he is But he cant do it alone, so Ive come here to help him
<name="bran"> Hes on his way back to Winterfell with Daenerys Targaryen You you saw this in a vision?
<name="sam"> Oh
<name="bran"> He needs to know the truth
<name="sam"> The truth about what?
<name="bran"> About himself No one knows No one but me Jon isnt really my fathers son Hes the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and my aunt
<name="sam"> Its not
<name="bran"> Dornish bastards are named Sand
<name="sam"> At the Citadel, I transcribed a High Septons diary He annulled Rhaegars marriage to Elia He wed Rhaegar and Lyanna in a secret ceremony
<name="bran"> Are you certain?
<name="sam"> Its what the High Septon wrote in his private diary I dont know why hed lie Is this something you can see?
<name="rhaegar"> Father, Smith, Warrior, Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger I am hers and she is mine from this day until the end of my days
<name="lyanna"> Father, Smith, Warrior, Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger I am his and he is mine from this day until the end of my days
<name="bran"> Roberts Rebellion was built on a lie Rhaegar didnt kidnap my aunt
<name="bran"> He loved her And she loved him
<name="bran"> And Jon Jons real name
<name="lyanna"> His name is Aegon
<name="bran"> Hes never been a bastard
<name="brans voice"> He needs to know We need to tell him
<name="arya"> Are you all right?
<name="sansa"> Its just strange In his own horrible way, I believe he loved me
<name="arya"> You did the right thing
<name="sansa"> You did it
<name="arya"> Im just the executioner You passed the sentence Youre the Lady
<name="sansa"> Does that bother you?
<name="arya"> I was never going to be as good a lady as you So I had to be something else I never could have survived what you survived
<name="sansa"> You would have Youre the strongest person I know
<name="arya"> I believe thats the nicest thing youve ever said to me
<name="sansa"> Well, dont get used to it Youre still very strange and annoying
<name="arya"> In winter, we must protect ourselves Look after one another
<name="father arya"> I miss him

Season 7
EPISODE "THE QUEENS JUSTICE" - 30/07/2017


<name="tyrion"> The bastard of Winterfell
<name="jon"> The dwarf of Casterly Rock
<name="tyrion"> I believe we last saw each other on top of the wall
<name="jon"> You were pissing off the edge, if I remember right You picked up some scars along the road
<name="tyrion"> Its been a long road But were both still here
<name="tyrion"> Im Tyrion Lannister
<name="davos"> Davos Seaworth and DAVOS shake hands
<name="tyrion"> Ah, the Onion Knight We fought on opposite sides at the Battle of Blackwater Bay
<name="davos"> Unluckily for me
<name="tyrion"> Missandei is the queens most trusted advisor
<name="missandei"> Welcome to Dragonstone Our queen knows this is a long journey She appreciates the effort you have made on her behalf If you wouldnt mind handing over your weapons
<name="jon"> Of course
<name="missandei"> Please, this way
<name="davos"> Where are you from? I cant place the accent
<name="missandei"> I was born on the Island of Naarth
<name="davos"> Ah I hear its beautiful down there Palm trees and butterflies I havent been myself
<name="davos"> This place has changed
<name="tyrion"> And Sansa, I hear shes alive and well
<name="jon"> She is
<name="tyrion"> Does she miss me terribly?
<name="tyrion"> A sham marriage and unconsummated
<name="jon"> I didnt ask -
<name="tyrion"> Well, it was It wasnt Anyway, shes much smarter than she lets on
<name="jon"> Shes starting to let on
<name="tyrion"> Good At some point I want to hear how a Knights Watch recruit became King in the North
<name="jon"> As long as you tell me how a Lannister became Hand to Daenerys Targaryen
<name="tyrion"> A long and bloody tale To be honest, I was drunk for most of it
<name="jon"> My bannermen think Im a fool for coming here
<name="tyrion"> Of course they do If I was your hand I would have advised against it General rule of thumb, Stark men dont fare well when they travel south
<name="jon"> True But Im not a Stark
<name="tyrion"> Id say you get used to them, but you never really do
<name="tyrion"> Come Their mother is waiting for you
<name="varys"> I wondered why you werent there to meet our guests You begged us to summon the King in the North Dont you want to see him again?
<name="melisandre"> Ive done my part Ive brought ice and fire together
<name="varys"> Strange You spoke so highly of Jon Snow but when he arrives you hide on a cliff I didnt take you for a bashful girl
<name="melisandre"> My time whispering in the ears of kings has come to an end
<name="varys"> Oh, I doubt that Give us common folk one taste of power were like the lion who tasted man Nothing is ever so sweet again
<name="melisandre"> Neither of us is common folk anymore I did not part on good terms with the King in the North, or his advisor
<name="varys"> Why?
<name="melisandre"> Because of mistakes I made Terrible mistakes I would only be a distraction if I stayed
<name="varys"> So where will you go?
<name="melisandre"> Volantis
<name="varys"> Good If you dont mind my saying, I dont think you should return to Westeros Im not sure youd be safe here
<name="melisandre"> I will return, dear spider One last time
<name="varys"> My Lady -
<name="melisandre"> I have to die in this strange country, just like you
<name="missandei"> You stand in the presence of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, rightful heir to the Iron Throne, rightful Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms, the Mother of Dragons, the Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, The Unburnt, The Breaker of Chains
<name="davos"> This is Jon Snow
<name="davos"> Hes King in the North
<name="daenerys"> Thank you for traveling so far, My Lords I hope the seas werent too rough
<name="jon"> The winds were kind, Your Grace
<name="davos"> Apologies I have a Flea Bottom accent, I know But Jon Snow is King in the North, Your Grace Hes not a lord
<name="daenerys"> Forgive me -
<name="tyrion"> Your Grace, this is Ser Davos Seaworth
<name="daerneys"> Forgive me, Ser Davos I never did receive a formal education, but I could have sworn the last King in the North was Torren Stark who bent the knee to my ancestor Aegon Targaryen in exchange for his life and the lives of the northmen Torren Stark swore fealty to House Targaryen in perpetuity But do I have my facts wrong?
<name="davos"> I wasnt there, Your Grace
<name="daenerys"> No Of course not But still, an oath is an oath In perpetuity means what does perpetuity mean, Lord Tyrion?
<name="tyrion"> Forever
<name="daenerys"> Forever So I assume, My Lord, that youre here to bend the knee
<name="jon"> I am not
<name="daenerys"> Oh Well, that is unfortunate Youve travelled all this way to break faith with House Targaryen?
<name="jon"> Break faith? Your father burned my grandfather alive He burned my uncle alive He would have burned the Seven Kingdoms
<name="daenerys"> My father was an evil man On behalf of House Targaryen I ask your forgiveness for the crimes he committed against your family And I ask you not to judge a daughter by the sins of her father Our two houses were allies for centuries Those were the best centuries the kingdoms ever known Centuries of peace and prosperity with the Targaryens sitting on the Iron Throne and a Stark serving as Warden of the North I am the last Targaryen, Jon Snow Honor the pledge your ancestor made to mine Bend the knee and I will name you Warden of the North Together we will save this country from those who would destroy it
<name="jon"> Youre right Youre not guilty of your fathers crime And Im not beholden to my ancestors vows
<name="daenerys"> Then why are you here?
<name="jon"> Because I need your help and you need mine
<name="daenerys"> Did you see three dragons flying overhead when you arrived?
<name="jon"> I did
<name="daenerys"> And did you see the Dothraki, all of whom have sworn to kill for me?
<name="jon"> Theyre hard to miss
<name="daenerys"> But still, I need your help?
<name="davos"> Not to defeat Cersei You could storm Kings Landing tomorrow and the city would fall Hell, we almost took it and we didnt even have dragons
<name="tyrion"> Almost
<name="jon"> But you havent stormed Kings Landing Why not? The only reason I can see is you dont want to kill thousands of innocent people Its the fastest way to win the war but you wont do it Which means at the very least youre better than Cersei
<name="daenerys"> Still, that doesnt explain why I need your help
<name="jon"> Because right now you and I and Cersei and everyone else, were children playing at a game screaming that the rules arent fair
<name="daenerys"> You told me you liked this man
<name="tyrion"> I do
<name="daenerys"> In the time since hes met me hes refused to call me queen, hes refused to bow and now hes calling me a child
<name="tyrion"> I believe hes calling all of us children Figure of speech
<name="jon"> Your Grace, everone you know will die before winter is over if we dont defeat the enemy to the north
<name="daenerys"> As far as I can see, you are the enemy to the north
<name="jon"> I am not your enemy The dead are the enemy
<name="daenerys"> The dead?
<name="daenerys"> Is that another figure of speech?
<name="jon"> The Army of the Dead is on the march
<name="tyrion"> The Army of the Dead?
<name="jon"> You dont know me well, My Lord, but do you think I am a liar or a madman?
<name="tyrion"> No, I dont think youre either of those things
<name="jon"> The Army of the Dead is real The White Walkers are real night King is real Ive seen them If they get past the wall and were squabbling amongst ourselves -
<name="jon"> were finished
<name="daenerys"> I was born at Dragonstone Not that I can remember it
<name="daenerys"> We fled before Roberts assassins could find us Robert was your fathers best friend, no? I wonder if your father knew his best friend sent assassins to murder a baby girl in her crib Not that it matters now of course I spent my life in foreign lands So many men have tried to kill me I dont remember all of their names I have been sold like a brood mare I have been chained and betrayed, raped and defiled Do you know what kept me standing through all those years in exile? Faith Not in any gods Not in myths and legends In myself In Daenerys Targaryen The world hadnt seen a dragon in centuries until my children were born The Dothraki hadnt crossed the sea Any sea
<name="daenerys"> They did for me I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms And I will
<name="jon"> Youll be ruling over a graveyard if we dont defeat the Night King
<name="tyrion"> The war against my sister has already begun You cant expect us to halt hostilities and join you in fighting -
<name="tyrion"> whatever you saw beyond the wall
<name="davos"> You dont believe him I understand that It sounds like nonsense
<name="davos"> But if destiny has brough Daenerys Targaryen back to our shores, it has also made Jon Snow King in the North You were the first to bring Dothraki to Westeros He was the first to make allies with Wildlings and northmen He was named Lord Commander of the Nights Watch He was named King in the North Not because of his birthright He has no birthright Hes a damn bastard All those hard sons of bitches chose him as their leader because they believe in him
<name="davos"> All those things you dont believe in, he faced those things He fought those things for the good of his people He risked his life for his people He took a knife in the heart for his people He gave his own -
<name="davos"> If we dont put asside our enmities and band together we will die And then it doesnt matter whose skeleton sits on the Iron Throne
<name="tyrion"> If it doesnt matter you might as well kneel
<name="tyrion"> Swear your allegiance to Queen Daenerys Help her to defeat my sister and together our armies will protect the north
<name="jon"> Theres no time for that Theres no time for any of this While we stand here debating -
<name="tyrion"> It takes no time to bend the knee Pledge your sword to her cause
<name="jon"> And why would I do that?
<name="jon"> I mean no offense, Your Grace, but I dont know you As far as I can tell your claim to the throne rests entirely on your fathers name And my own father fought to overthrow the Mad King The lords of the north placed their trust in me to lead them And I will continue to do so as well as I can
<name="daenerys"> Thats fair Its also fair to point out that Im the rightful queen of the Seven Kingdoms By declaring yourself king of the northern most kingdom, you are in open rebellion
<name="daenerys"> You must forgive my manners You will both be tired after your long journey Well have baths drawn for you and supper sent to your rooms
<name="jon"> Am I your prisoner?
<name="daenerys"> Not yet
<name="varys"> Our Iron Born and Dornish allies were attacked on route to Dorne
<name="daenerys"> And?
<name="varys"> Two or three ships escaped The rest sunk our captured Ellaria and the sand snakes dead or captured The Greyjoys are dead or captured
<name="daenerys"> All of them?
<name="of dorne captain"> Your sisters dead?
<name="theon"> Euron has her
<name="captain"> You saw him take her? And you got away?
<name="theon"> I couldnt save her I tried
<name="captain"> You wouldnt be here if you tried
<name="streets euron"> This is the life Look at them Cheering for a Greyjoy
<name="euron"> I have to be honest, its making me hard Did you see little Theons face right before he jumped overboard?
<name="euron"> Oh no
<name="euron"> What a twat
<name="euron"> My queen Please accept this gift on behalf of all of your loyal subjects in the Iron Islands
<name="euron"> I give you -
<name="euron"> what no other man could give Justice Justice for your murdered daughter
<name="cersei"> Youve proven yourself the greatest captain on the 14 seas and a true friend to the crown
<name="euron"> A bit more than a true friend
<name="cersei"> And you deserve a proper reward for your heroism
<name="euron"> Theres only one reward I want
<name="cersei"> You shall have what your heart desires -
<name="cersei"> when the war is won
<name="cersei"> With Euron Greyjoy commanding our naval forces and Jaime Lannister leading our armies, the sons and daugters of Westeros shall defend our country
<name="euron"> Theres nothing quite like it, is there? The love of the people I suppose you wouldnt know
<name="jaime"> This same mob spat at my sister not long ago, and if you turn on us, theyll cheer to see your head mounted on a spike
<name="euron"> Or yours They just like severed heads really Listen, if you have any advice at all Id love to hear it when we have an hour or two to speak as brothers
<name="jaime"> Advice?
<name="euron"> Does she like it gentle or rough? A finger in the bum?
<name="euron"> Shhh, shhh, shhh, not now Well talk later
<name="cut to"> RED KEEP
<name="cersei"> I want you to know I understand Even though were enemies, you and I, I understand the fear that drives you I was there that day when Ser Gregor crushed your lovers head I close my eyes I can hear the sound of Oberyns skull breaking
<name="cersei"> The sound of your scream I never heard a sound like that I thought, thats true love Oberyn looked beautiful that day He really did No one moved like him No one had such skill with a spear Even Ser Gregor couldnt stop him If only he hadnt taunted him He could have walked away and left poor Ser Gregor to die But that wasnt your lovers way, was it? Now hes burried somewhere And here Ser Gregor is stronger than ever That must be difficult for you When my daughter was taken from me, my only daughter, well, you cant imagine how that feels unless youve lost a child I fed her at my own breast even though they told me to give her to the wet nurse I couldnt bear to see her in another womans arms I never got to have a mother But Myrcella did She was mine and you took her from me Why did you do that?
<name="cersei"> It doesnt matter now
<name="cersei"> Your daughter is a beauty too Brown eyes, those lips A perfect Dornish beauty
<name="cersei"> I imagine she is your favorite
<name="cersei"> I know, I know, were not supposed to have favorites But still, were only human We love who we love
<name="cersei"> Im sorry I cant understand you The gag makes it difficult to understand what youre saying It must be frustrating
<name="cersei"> We all make our choices You chose to murder my daughter You must have felt powerful after you made that choice
<name="cersei"> Do you feel powerful now? I dont sleep very well, not at all really I lie in bed and I stare at the canopy and imagine ways of killing my enemies How to destroy Ellaria Sand, the woman who murdered my only daughter I thought about having Ser Gregor crush your skull the way he did Oberyns It would be poetic I suppose but fast Too fast
<name="cersei"> I thought about having him crush your daughters skull
<name="cersei"> Shes so beautiful The thought of this lovely face cracking open like a duck egg, no, its just not right
<name="tyene"> Momma
<name="cersei"> Qyburn, hes the cleverest man I know Clever enough to learn what poison you used to murder Myrcella The long goodbye, was that it?
<name="qyburn"> The Long Farewell
<name="cersei"> Thats the one
<name="cersei"> How long does the poison take?
<name="qyburn"> Difficult to say Hours, days, it depends on the subjects constitution
<name="cersei"> But death is certain?
<name="qyburn"> Oh yes, Your Grace, quite certain
<name="cersei"> Your daughter will die here in this cell You will be here watching when she does You will be here the rest of your days If you refuse to eat we will force food down your throat You will live to watch your daughter rot, to watch that beautiful face collapse to bone and dust all the while contemplating the choices youve made
<name="cersei"> Make sure the guards change the torches every few hours I dont want her to miss a thing
<name="cut to"> RED KEEP
<name="jaimes quarters jaime"> No
<name="jaime"> Dont
<name="jaime"> What are you doing? No one can see us like this ?
<name="cersei"> I am queen of the Seven Kingdoms Ill do as I please
<name="messenger"> Forgive me, Your Grace The visitor from Braavos has arrived
<name="cersei"> Good And well need fresh sheets for the bed
<name="messenger"> At once, Your Grace
<name="cut to"> RED KEEP
<name="council room tycho"> No, thank you
<name="tycho"> My condolences, Your Grace, on the death of your son From all reports he was a fine young man
<name="cersei"> The Iron Bank didnt send you hear to offer condolences
<name="tycho"> Condolences and congratulations Youve become the first ruling queen in the Seven Kingdoms Thats quite an accomplishment The Iron Bank appreciates how you cast off the yoke of superstition freeing the crown from elements that sought to subvert the rule of law
<name="cersei"> The destruction of the Sept of Baelor was a tragic accident
<name="tycho"> Indeed But sometimes tragedies are necessary to restore order and rational leadership
<name="cersei"> The Iron Bank wants its gold back
<name="tycho"> Your father never minced words either But, yes, your debts are considerable And you are now engaged in a conflict on several fronts We both know how expensive war can be
<name="cersei"> And we both know gold wins wars Your vaults are empty Your late husbands profligacy saw to that
<name="tycho"> Your wealthiest ally is the Tyrells who are now your enemies Youre surrounded on all sides by rivals for the throne
<name="cersei"> And the Iron Bank wants to bet on a winner
<name="tycho"> We dont make bets We invest in endeavors we deem likely to be successful
<name="cersei"> Thats a fancy way of saying bet The war has already begun Ive drawn first blood I decapitated the Dornish snake My armada owns the Narrow Sea
<name="tycho"> Euron Greyjoys armada owns the Narrow Sea
<name="cersei"> Euron Greyjoy is loyal to me
<name="tycho"> For now Daenerys Targaryen has three full grown dragons How well do wooden ships fare against fire breathing dragons?
<name="cersei"> Her dragons might not be as invulnerable as some think Now, lets talk about the Targaryen girl You want to invest in her? Im guessing the Iron Bank invested considerable gold in the slave trade How are you profits now that Daenerys has freed all the slaves?
<name="tycho"> The slave trade has entered a down turn, its true
<name="cersei"> From what I gather she considers herself more of a revolutionary that a monarch In your experience how do bankers usually fare with revoltionaries?
<name="cersei"> The Lannisters owe the Iron Bank quite a lot of money but Lannisters always pay their debts Do former slaves or Dothraki or dragons?
<name="tycho"> Your fathers daughter indeed
<name="cersei"> Give me a fortnight Stay in Kings Landing as my honored guest and when you return to Braavos I swear to you my debt will be paid in full
<name="tyrion"> I came out here to brood over my failure to predict the Greyjoy attack Youre making it difficult You look a lot better brooding than I do You make me feel like Im failing at brooding over failing
<name="jon"> Im a prisoner on this island
<name="tyrion"> I wouldnt say youre a prisoner on this island Youre free to walk the castle, the beaches, to go wherever you want
<name="jon"> Except to my ship They took my ship
<name="tyrion"> I wouldnt say we took your ship
<name="jon"> Im not playing word games with you The dead are coming for us all
<name="tyrion"> Why dont you figure out what to do about my missing fleet and murdered allies, and Ill figure out what to do about your walking dead men
<name="jon"> Its hard for me to fathom It really is If someone told me about the White Walkers and the Night King -
<name="jon"> You probably dont believe me
<name="tyrion"> I do actually
<name="jon"> You didnt before Grumpkins and snarks you called them Do you remember? You said it was all nonsense
<name="tyrion"> It was all nonsense Everybody knew it But then Mormont saw them and you saw them, and I trust the eyes of an honest man more than I trust what everybody knows
<name="jon"> How do I convince people who dont know me that an enemey they dont believe in is coming to kill them all?
<name="tyrion"> Good question
<name="jon"> I know its a good question Im looking for an answer
<name="tyrion"> Peoples minds arent made for problems that large White Walkers, the Night King, Army of the Dead, its almost a relief to confront a familiar monster like my sister
<name="jon"> I need to help prepare my people for whats coming I cant help them from here Id like to leave
<name="tyrion"> It seems unlikely that you became King in the North by giving up that easily
<name="jon"> Everyone told me to learn from my fathers mistakes Dont go south Dont answer a summons from the Mad Kings daughter, a foreign invader And here I am A northern fool
<name="tyrion"> Children are not their fathers, luckily for all of us And sometimes theres more to foreign invaders than northern fools that meets the eye Daenerys could have sailed for Westeros long ago but she didnt Instead she stayed where she was and saved many people from horrible fates some of whom are on this island with us right now While youre our guest here you might consider asking them what they think of the Mad Kings daughter She protects people from monsters, just as you do Thats why she came here And shes not about to head north to fight an enemy shes never seen on a word of a man she doesnt know after a single meeting Thats not a reasonable thing to ask
<name="tyrion"> So do you have anything reasonable to ask?
<name="jon"> What do you mean?
<name="tyrion"> Maybe you are a northern fool Im asking if theres something I can do to help you
<name="daenerys"> Dragonglass?
<name="tyrion"> Yes Volcanic glass, obsidian He says you have a tremendous amount of it here
<name="daenerys"> Why are we talking about glass? We just lost two of our allies
<name="tyrion"> Which is why I was speaking to Jon Snow, a potential ally
<name="daenerys"> And what does the King in the North want with Dragonglass?
<name="tyrion"> Apparently it can be turned into weapons that kill White Walkers and their foot soldiers, or stop them, destroy them Im unsure of the nomenclature
<name="daenerys"> And what do you think of this Army of the Dead and White Walkers and Night Kings?
<name="tyrion"> Id very much like to believe that Jon Snow is wrong, but a wise man once said that you should never believe a thing simply because you want to believe it
<name="daenerys"> Which wise man said this?
<name="tyrion"> I dont remember
<name="daenerys"> Are you trying to present your own statements as ancient wisdom?
<name="tyrion"> I would never do that to you The reason I believe Jon Snow is because hes here All of his advisors would have told him not to come I would have told him not to come, yet hes here anyway You dont have to believe him Let him mine the Dragonglass If hes wrong its worthless You didnt even know it was here Its nothing to you Give him something by giving him nothing Take a step toward a more productive relationship with a possible ally Keep him occupied while we focus on the task at hand Casterly Rock
<name="daenerys"> What was that Ser Davos said about taking a knife in the heart for his people? Did you notice that?
<name="tyrion"> You must allow them their flights of fancy Its dreary in the north
<name="walkways jon"> Amazing thing to see
<name="daenerys"> I named them for my brothers Vicerys and Rhaegon Theyre both gone now
<name="daenerys"> You lost two brothers as well?
<name="daenerys"> People thought dragons were gone forever but here they are Perhaps we should all be examining what we think we know
<name="jon"> Youve been talking to Tyrion?
<name="daenerys"> He is my Hand
<name="jon"> He enjoys talking
<name="daenerys"> We all enjoy what were good at
<name="jon"> I dont
<name="daenerys"> You know Im not going to let Cersei stay on the Iron Throne
<name="jon"> I never expected that you would
<name="daenerys"> And I havent changed my mind about which kingdoms belong to the throne
<name="jon"> I havent either
<name="daenerys"> I will allow you to mine the Dragonglass and forge weapons from it Any resources or men you need I will provide for you
<name="jon"> Thank you
<name="jon"> So you believe me then about the Night King and the Army of the Dead?
<name="daenerys"> You better get to work, Jon Snow
<name="sansa"> How much do we have?
<name="wolkan"> 4,000 bushels, My Lady
<name="sansa"> What does that mean?
<name="yohn"> For the current occupants of the castle its enough food for a year, perhaps more
<name="sansa"> Whats the longest winter in the past 100 years?
<name="wolkan"> Im not entirely certain Ill check Maester Llewyns records He kept a copy of every raven scroll
<name="sansa"> Youre telling me we dont have enough food, especially not if the armies of the north come back to defend Winterfell
<name="wolkan"> No, My Lady, most likely not
<name="sansa"> We must prepare for that eventuality Every direction the threat comes from, this is the best place to be We need to start building up our grain stores with regular shipments from every keep in the north If we dont use it by winters end well give it back to them, but if the entire north has to flee to Winterfell there wont be enough time to bring wagonloads of grain with them
<name="yohn"> Very wise, My Lady
<name="sansa"> Maester Wolkan, youll see to it?
<name="sansa"> Are they covering those breastplates in leather?
<name="yohn"> No, My Lady
<name="sansa"> Well, shouldnt they be once the real cold comes?
<name="yohn"> They should indeed Pardon me, My Lady
<name="yohn"> You there, why isnt there leather on these?
<name="littlefinger"> Command suits you The northerns are all facing north worried about the threat beyond the wall
<name="sansa"> So they should be
<name="littlefinger"> I know Cersei better than anyone here If you turn your back on her -
<name="sansa"> You dont know Cersei better than anyone here
<name="littlefinger"> I only meant to say -
<name="sansa"> That the woman who murdered my mother, father and brother is dangerous? Thank you for your wise council
<name="littlefinger"> One of two things will happen Either the dead will defeat the living, in which case all our troubles come to an end Or life will win out And what then?
<name="littlefinger"> Dont fight in the north or the south Fight every battle everywhere always in your mind Everyone is your enemy, everyone is your friend, every possible series of events is happening all at once Live that way and nothing will surprise you Everything that happens will be something that youve seen before
<name="guard"> Lady Sansa, at the gate
<name="bran"> Hello, Sansa
<name="sansa"> I wish Jon was here
<name="bran"> Yes I need to speak to him
<name="sansa"> Your fathers last living true born son Youre Lord of Winterfell
<name="bran"> I can never be the Lord of Winterfell I can never be lord of anything Im the three-eyed raven
<name="sansa"> I dont know what that means
<name="bran"> Its difficult to explain
<name="sansa"> Try, please, for me
<name="bran"> It means I can see everything Everything thats ever happened to everyone Everything thats happening right now Its all pieces, fragments I need to learn to see better When the long night comes again I need to be ready
<name="sansa"> How do you know all of this?
<name="bran"> The three-eyed raven taught me
<name="sansa"> I thought you were the three-eyed raven
<name="bran"> I told you its difficult to explain
<name="sansa"> Bran -
<name="bran"> Im sorry for all thats happened to you Im sorry it had to happen here at our home It was so beautiful that night Snow falling just like now And you were so beautiful in your white wedding dress
<name="sansa"> I have to go back inside, Bran
<name="bran"> Ill stay a bit longer
<name="cut to"> CITADEL
<name="quarantine rooms marwyn"> Hmm
<name="marwyn"> Hmm Does it hurt?
<name="jorah"> A bit Less than before
<name="marwyn"> The infection no longer appears to be active
<name="marwyn"> Unusual Unlikely One could almost be forgiven for thinking the entire upper layer of diseased skin was debrided and the underlying region treated with some sort of ointment
<name="jorah"> I dont know anything about that I just started feeling better I assumed it was the rest that did it
<name="jorah"> And the climate
<name="marwyn"> The climate? Youre free to go, Ser This chamber is needed for the infectious, which you are no longer
<name="marwyn"> Tarley, Id like to speak with you in my study this evening
<name="jorah"> How bad is it?
<name="sam"> I suppose Ill find out this evening
<name="sam"> Where will you go?
<name="jorah"> I surrendered to this sickness the moment I first saw it I knew it would kill me or Id kill myself before it could Daenerys Stormborn convinced me otherwise The only place for me is with her
<name="jorah"> I owe my life to her and you
<name="sam"> Your father saved me more than once Its the least I could do
<name="jorah"> Perhaps our paths will cross again?
<name="sam"> I hope they do
<name="cut to"> ARCHMAESTERS STUDY
<name="marwyn"> You treated him?
<name="sam"> Yes
<name="marwyn"> Who told you to treat him?
<name="sam"> No one
<name="marwyn"> Who forbade you or anyone to attempt to treat him?
<name="sam"> I seem to remember you
<name="marwyn"> But you treated him anyway?
<name="sam"> I did
<name="marwyn"> I forbade it because its dangerous and rarely successful Especially on someone of that age You could have infected yourself and others You could have devastated the entire Citadel But you didnt Its a meticulous, difficult procedure Many maesters whose chains are heavy with healing links have attempted it and failed But you succeeded How?
<name="sam"> I read the books and followed the instructions
<name="marwyn"> That man is alive because of you You should be proud
<name="sam"> Thank you, Archmaester
<name="marwyn"> Come here
<name="marwyn"> All these manuscripts and scrolls and rotting away I need you to make copies of them
<name="marwyn"> You were expecting a reward? Your reward is not being immediately expelled from the Citadel Youd better get started Be mindful of the paper mites They like flesh as well
<name="daenerys"> We need to find Euron Greyjoys fleet and sink it
<name="varys"> Your Grace, hes already destroyed a good portion of our fleet To send our remaining ships after him -
<name="daenerys"> Im not talking about sending our ships after him
<name="tyrion"> But youll have to go yourself Eurons ships could be anywhere or in more than one place Youd be flying around the open seas alone for who knows how long
<name="daenerys"> I wouldnt be alone Id have Drogon, Vicerion and Rhaegal What can anyone do to them?
<name="missandei"> They can still do something to you It only takes one arrow
<name="tyrion"> Its too great a risk Youre too important
<name="daenerys"> What about Casterly Rock?
<name="varys"> The Unsullied will be there soon
<name="missandei"> And what will they face?
<name="varys"> A difficult situation They know were coming
<name="tyrion"> Yes Cersei believes my sole purpose in life is to destroy House Lannister She will be ready
<name="tyrion"> No one has ever taken the rock
<name="tyrion"> The Lannister army is still the army my father built Well trained and well provisioned 10,000 men at least They will see us coming
<name="tyrion"> They will be ready
<name="man"> Draw! Loose
<name="tyrion"> The gates of Casterly Rock are impregnable
<name="tyrion"> The fight up the walls will be hard Well be at a disadvantage Many men will die
<name="tyrion"> Interesting thing about my father He built our house up from near ruin He built our army He built Casterly Rock as we know it, but he didnt build the sewers That was beneath him So he gave the job to the lowest person he could find Me He was right I was low The company I kept low, women mostly They werent welcome at the Rock Father disapproved of that sort of behavior I couldnt walk them through the front gates I couldnt have them in my chambers So in the process of building the sewers I threw in something for myself
<name="tyrion"> It was a passage that began by the sea and ended beneath one of the main guard towers
<name="tyrion"> No better place for low pursuits Casterly Rock, the impregnable fortress
<name="tyrion"> As a good friend of mine once said, give me 10 good men and Ill impregnate the bitch
<name="tyrion"> And so it begins They will face the bulk of the Lannister forces They will be outnumbered They will have less armor and fewer weapons
<name="tyrion"> But as my sisters armies fights for her, the Unsullied will be fighting for something greater They will be fighting for freedom and the person who gave it to them They will be fighting for you And that is why they will triump
<name="unsullied"> There are none left
<name="grey worm"> There are supposed to be more than this Many more
<name="grey worm"> Where are they? Where are the rest of the Lannisters?
<name="cut to"> HIGHGARDEN
<name="fields cut to"> HIGHGARDEN
<name="cut to"> S QUARTERS
<name="olenna"> Its done?
<name="jaime"> It is
<name="olenna"> And now the rains weep for our whores Did we fight well?
<name="jaime"> I suppose as well as can be expected
<name="olenna"> It was never our forte Golden roses indeed Your brother and his new queen thought you would be defending Casterly Rock
<name="jaime"> The truth is Casterly Rock isnt worth much anymore Well, it is to me My fond childhood memories wont keep Cersei on the throne
<name="olenna"> So youll just let them take it?
<name="jaime"> For now They wont be able to hold it Euron Greyjoys navy burned their ships, we emptied the larders before we left Eventually theyll be forced to abandon their position and march all the way across Westeros
<name="olenna"> And you took your army, your real army, and went where they werent?
<name="jaime"> As Robb Stark did to me at Whispering Wood There are always lessons in failures
<name="olenna"> Yes You must be very wise by now
<name="jaime"> My father always said I was a slow learner
<name="olenna"> If he was so clever why didnt he take Highgarden the moment your gold mines ran dry? I suppose Ill be able to ask him myself soon enough No more learning from my mistakes, eh? How will you do it? With that sword?
<name="olenna"> That was Joffreys sword, wasnt it? Not that he ever used it What did he call it?
<name="jaime"> Widows Wail
<name="olenna"> He really was a cunt, wasnt he? I did unspeakable things to protect my family, or watched them being done on my orders I never lost a nights sleep over them They were necessary And whatever I imagined necessary for the safety of House Tyrell I did But your sister has done things I wasnt capable of imagining That was my prize mistake, a failure of imagination Shes a monster, you do know that?
<name="jaime"> To you, sure To others as well But after weve won and theres no one left to oppose us, the people living peaceful in the world she built, do you really think theyll wring their hands over the way she built it?
<name="olenna"> You love her You really do love her You poor fool Shell be the end of you
<name="jaime"> Possibly Not much to be gained from discussing it with you though, is there?
<name="olenna"> What better person to discuss it with? What better guarantee could you have that the things you say will never leave this room? But perhaps youre right If shes driven you this far its gone beyond your control
<name="jaime"> Yes, it has
<name="olenna"> Shes a disease I regret my role in spreading it You will too
<name="jaime"> I think were done here
<name="olenna"> How will it happen?
<name="jaime"> Cersei had several ideas Whipping you through the streets and beheading you in front of the Red Keep Flaying you alive and hanging you from the walls of Kings Landing I talked her out of those
<name="olenna"> Will there be pain?
<name="jaime"> No I made sure of that
<name="olenna"> Thats good




Season 7
EPISODE "THE SPOILS OF WAR" - 06/08/2017


<name="jaime"> Halt that wagon! JAIME opens the carriage It is filled with gold bars and coins He picks up a large sack and hands it t
<name="bronn"> You just won the biggest prize in the world What could you possibly have to be upset about? Come on You can tell me Queen of Thorns give you one last prick in the balls before saying goodbye?
<name="jaime"> Ill save my confessions for the High Septon
<name="bronn"> There is no more High Septon
<name="jaime"> No, there isnt, is there?
<name="bronn"> There is still the question of my prize is putting a padlock on the wagon bearing the gold He stops and turns to BRONN
<name="jaime"> Thats a lot of money I just gave you
<name="bronn"> Its not a castle turns and points to Highgarden
<name="bronn"> How about that one? Its available
<name="jaime"> You dont want Highgarden
<name="bronn"> I beg to differ
<name="jaime"> Were at war Daenerys Targaryen could come take it back the day after you move in Besides, think of the upkeep The more you own, the more it weighs you down
<name="bronn"> Oh, is that why youre so fucking glum, eh? All your new riches weighing you down pounds on the back of the carriage and the horses start trotting
<name="jaime"> Theyre not mine The gold belongs to the Iron Bank We pay our debts
<name="bronn"> Right Just not to me
<name="jaime"> Bronn of the Blackwater, formerly of whatever nameless shit heap youre from with a saddlebag full of gold complaining about not getting paid When we win this war all the castles in the Seven Kingdoms will be yours to choose from with no one left to take them away from you
<name="bronn"> Yes, Im sure Queen Cerseis reign will be quiet and peaceful
<name="jaime"> Stranger things have happened
<name="bronn"> Like what TARLEY and his son DICKON come riding up on horseback addresses JAIME
<name="randyll"> The granaries are being emptied and loaded into wagons, My Lord
<name="jaime"> The current harvest?
<name="dickon"> We have teams of men collecting it and more farmers in the Reach looks over to BRONN
<name="jaime"> Ser Bronn, will you accompany the Tarleys and help them accelerate this process?
<name="bronn"> Im not much for shoveling weight
<name="jaime"> No, but motivating reluctant farmers to hand over their harvest, Ive heard you guys have a real talent for that
<name="randyll"> My Lord
<name="dickon"> My Lord RANDYLL, DICKON and BRONN break away from the Lannister army and ride into the distance Horse drawn carts are carrying spoils from Highgarden and Lannister men are marching down the road
<name="cut to"> REDKEEP COUNCIL ROOM CERSEI an NESTORIS from the Iron Bank of Braavos are sitting having a discussion
<name="tycho"> I must say, I dont think the Iron Bank has ever had a debt of this magnitude repaid in a single installment I always considered your father a very effective and efficient man, but you appear to be redefining those terms entirely
<name="cersei"> Youre too kind, My Lord
<name="tycho"> I am neither kind, nor a lord, Your Grace I am merely an instrument of the institution I represent, its wellbeing is a matter of arithmetic, not sentiment And the current arithmetic is outstanding The gold -
<name="cersei"> Is on its way My brother is supervising its transportation himself
<name="tycho"> Some at the Iron Bank will be disappointed Theyve grown rather fond of your interest payments
<name="cersei"> We must devise a way to raise their spirits
<name="tycho"> Yes Perhaps we could be of assistance in some current venture
<name="cersei"> My only venture at the moment is reestablishing control over this continent and every person on it
<name="tycho"> I see a great deal of potential in that venture I imagine that it would require outside investment?
<name="cersei"> It will indeed I need to expand my armies, my navies My hand, Qyburn, had made overtures to the Golden Company in Essos
<name="tycho"> I know them well Theyve helped us recover significant sums from parties who had fallen into deep arrears
<name="cersei"> Thats good to hear I too would like them to recover some things that belong to me
<name="tycho"> Rest assured, Your Grace, you can count on the Iron Banks support, as soon as the gold arrives BRANS QUARTERS BRAN is sitting in a wheelchair PETE is sitting next to him unsheathes a Valyrian steel dagger and shows it to BRAN Its the same dagger used in the attempt to assassinate BRAN years ago
<name="littlefinger"> This is for you flips the knife in his hand and extends it towards BRAN
<name="littlefinger"> The last man who wielded it meant to cut your throat, but your mother fought him off BRAN reaches out and takes the knife, turning it and looking it over carefully
<name="littlefinger"> The other dagger, the one that took her life, I would have stopped that dagger with my own heart if I could have I wasnt there for her when she needed me most But I am here for her now To do what she would have done, to protect her children Anything I can do for you, Brandon, you need only ask
<name="bran"> Do you know who this belonged to?
<name="littlefinger"> No That very question was what started the War of the Five Kings In a way, that dagger made you what you are today Forced from your home, driven out to the wilds beyond the Wall I imagine youve seen things most men wouldnt believe hands the sheath of the knife to BRAN BRAN slides the knife into the sheath
<name="littlefinger"> To go through all of that and make your way home again only to find such chaos in the world, I can only imagine -
<name="bran"> Chaos is a ladder BRAN is staring a stops speaking The door opens and Meera appears
<name="littlefinger"> Im sorry to have disturbed you, Lord Stark BAELISH stands up to leave
<name="bran"> Im not Lord Stark BAELISH bows and walks past Meera and closes the door notices BRAN sitting in a wheelchair
<name="meera"> Whats that?
<name="bran"> Maester Wolkan built it for me so I can move around more easily
<name="meera"> Its a very good idea
<name="bran"> Youre leaving?
<name="meera"> I dont want to leave you, but when they come I need to be with my family And youre safe, safe as anyone can be now You dont need me anymore
<name="bran"> No, I dont
<name="meera"> Thats all youve got to say?
<name="bran"> Thank you
<name="meera"> Thank you?
<name="bran"> For helping me
<name="meera"> My brother died for you Hodor and Summer died for you I almost died for you Bran
<name="bran"> Im not really, not anymore I remember what it felt like to be Brandon Stark, but I remember so much else now begins to cry
<name="meera"> You died in that cave MEERA turns to walk out the door She hesitates looking at BRAN, then walks out
<name="nan"> There is a snow blown field ARYA is riding on a horse Winterfell can be seen far in the distance
<name="cut to"> GATE ARYA approaches the main gate on foot Two guards are huddled by a brazier getting warm Theres indistinct chatter One of the men notice ARYA walking to the gate and approach her
<name="man"> Hey, oh Where are you going?
<name="arya"> In there I live here
<name="man"> Fuck off
<name="arya"> Im Arya Stark This is my home Both men look at each and start laughing
<name="man"> Arya Stark is dead
<name="arya"> Send for Maester Llewyn or Ser Rodrick Theyll tell you who I am
<name="man"> Theres no Rodrick here
<name="man"> Maesters name is Wolkan
<name="arya"> Go ask Jon Snow then, the King in the North Hes my brother
<name="man"> Hes a thousand miles away
<name="man"> Its cold Were busy So, you know, best fuck off
<name="man"> Mm-hmm
<name="arya"> If Jon Snow is gone who is in charge of Winterfell?
<name="man"> The Lady of Winterfell, Lady Stark
<name="arya"> Which Lady Stark?
<name="man"> You tell us Youre the one impersonating her sister
<name="arya"> Tell Sansa her sister is home
<name="man"> Lady Sansa is too busy to waster her breath on you, just like us So for the last time, fuck off MAN 1 goes to grab Arya but she easily dodges out of his grasp
<name="arya"> Im getting into this castle one way or another If Im not who I say I am, I wont last long But if I am, and Sansa finds out that you turned me away ARYA keeps glancing at the men They look uneasy They bring her inside of the gate They indicate towards a cart near the entrance
<name="man"> You sit there Right there Dont move Both guards have a conversation out of earshot of Arya
<name="man"> Go tell Lady Stark Ill watch her ARYA is glancing around Winterfell Men are working building tools and cutting wood ARYA looks over and sees a Winterfell flag sigil hanging from the wall The two guards are still arguing
<name="man"> You tell her
<name="man"> Im not
<name="man"> Because if you dont Ill hit you right in the fucking face as hard as I can The guards turn around and ARYA is gone
<name="cut to"> INT WINTERFELL SANSAS QUARTERS Sansa is sitting at a table reviewing documents The two guards are in Sansas room explaining what happened
<name="man"> We told her to wait We were standing right next to her
<name="man"> When we turned around she had gone, My Lady She was nothing Some winter town girl
<name="man"> She comes in asking for Ser Rodrick and Maester Llewyn
<name="man"> Dont trouble yourself over it, My Lady Well find her

<name="arya"> Do I have to call you Lady Stark now hesitates for a moment
<name="sansa"> Yes begins smiling then walking towards ARYA reaches out and hugs ARYA
<name="sansa"> You shouldnt have run from the guards
<name="arya"> I didnt run You need better guards SANSA smirks a
<name="arya"> It suits you, Lady Stark Jon left you in charge?
<name="sansa"> I hope he comes back soon I remember how happy he was to see me When he sees you, his heart will probably stop Both girls turn and look at the statue of Ned Stark
<name="arya"> That doesnt look like him It should have been carved by someone who knew his face
<name="sansa"> Everyone who knew his face is dead
<name="arya"> Were not turns to face SANSA
<name="arya"> They say you killed Joffrey Did you?
<name="sansa"> I wish I had
<name="arya"> Me too I was angry when I heard someone else had done it However long my list got he was always first
<name="sansa"> Your list?
<name="arya"> Of people Im going to kill begins to laugh ARYA joins her
<name="sansa"> How did you get back to Winterfell?
<name="arya"> Its a long story I imagine yours is too
<name="sansa"> Yes Its not a very pleasant one
<name="arya"> Mine neither, but our stories arent over yet
<name="sansa"> No, theyre not The girls both embrace again

<name="bran"> You came home ARYA steps forward and throws her arms aroun SANSA smiles in the background ARYA lets go and steps back

<name="arya"> You saw me?
<name="bran"> I see quite a lot now
